<h2>Preface</h2>


<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="smcap">Away</span> up toward the frozen north lies the
great peninsula, which the United States bought
from the Russians, and thus became responsible
for the native peoples from whom the Russians
had taken the land.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of people there, from
Indians to Esquimos, and they are under the
American Government, yet they have no votes
and are not called American citizens.</p>

<p>It is about this country and its people that
this little story is written, and in the hope of
interesting American girls and boys in these
very strange people, their Little Alaskan Cousins.</p>

<h2>Our Little Alaskan Cousin</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KALITAN TENAS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was bitterly cold. Kalitan Tenas felt it
more than he had in the long winter, for then
it was still and calm as night, and now the wind
was blowing straight in from the sea, and the
river was frozen tight.</p>

<p>A month before, the ice had begun to break
and he had thought the cold was over, and that
the all too short Alaskan summer was at hand.
Now it was the first of May, and just as he
had begun to think of summer pleasures, lo!
a storm had come which seemed to freeze the
very marrow of his bones. However, our little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Alaskan cousin was used to cold and trained
to it, and would not dream of fussing over a
little snow-storm.</p>

<p>Kalitan started out to fish for his dinner,
and though the snow came down heavily and
he had to break through the ice to make a
fishing-hole, and soon the ice was a wind-swept
plain where even his own tracks were covered
with a white pall, he fished steadily on. He
never dreamed of stopping until he had fish
enough for dinner, for, like most of his tribe,
he was persevering and industrious.</p>

<p>Kalitan was a Thlinkit, though, if you asked
him, he would say he was "Klinkit." This is
a tribe which has puzzled wise people for a
long time, for the Thlinkits are not Esquimos,
not Indians, not coloured people, nor whites.
They are the tribes living in Southeastern
Alaska and along the coast. Many think that
a long, long time ago, they came from Japan
or some far Eastern country, for they look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
something like the Japanese, and their language
has many words similar to Japanese in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps, long years ago, some shipwrecked
Japanese were cast upon the coast of Alaska,
and, finding their boats destroyed and the land
good to live in, settled there, and thus began
the Thlinkit tribes.</p>

<p>The Chilcats, Haidahs, and Tsimsheans are
all Thlinkits, and are by far the best of the
brown people of the Northland. They are
honest, simple, and kind, and more intelligent
than the Indians living farther north, in the
colder regions. The Thlinkit coast is washed
by the warm current from the Japan Sea, and
it is not much colder than Chicago or Boston,
though the winter is a little longer.</p>

<p>Kalitan fished diligently but caught little.
He was warmly clad in sealskin; around his
neck was a white bearskin ruff, as warm as
toast, and very pretty, too, as soft and fluffy as
a lady's boa. On his feet were moccasins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
walrus hide. He had been perhaps an hour
watching the hole in the ice, and knelt there
so still that he looked almost as though he were
frozen. Indeed, that was what those thought
who saw him there, for suddenly a dog-sledge
came round the corner of the hill and a loud
halloo greeted his ears.</p>

<p>"Boston men," he said to himself as he
watched them, "lost the trail."</p>

<p>They had indeed lost the trail, and Ted
Strong had begun to think they would never
find it again.</p>

<p>Chetwoof, their Indian guide, had not talked
very much about it, but lapsed into his favourite
"No understan'," a remark he always made
when he did not want to answer what was said
to him.</p>

<p>Ted and his father were on their way from
Sitka to the Copper River. Mr. Strong was
on the United States Geological Survey, which
Ted knew meant that he had to go all around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the country and poke about all day among rocks
and mountains and glaciers. He had come with
his father to this far Alaskan clime in the happiest
expectation of adventures with bears and
Indians, always dear to the heart of a boy.</p>

<p>He was pretty tired of the sledge, having
been in it since early morning, and he was cold
and hungry besides; so he was delighted when
the dogs stopped and his father said:</p>

<p>"Hop out, son, and stretch your legs. We'll
try to find out where we are before we go any
farther."</p>

<p>Chetwoof meanwhile was interviewing the
boy, who came quickly toward them.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Chetwoof.</p>

<p>"Kalitan Tenas," was the brief reply.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"Near to Pilchickamin River."</p>

<p>"Where is a camp?"</p>

<p>"There," said the boy, pointing toward a
clump of pine-trees. "Ours."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Ted by this time was tired of his own unwonted
silence, and he came up to Kalitan,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"My name is Ted Strong," he said, genially,
grinning cheerfully at the young Alaskan. "I
say this is a jolly place. I wish you would teach
me to fish in a snow-hole. It must be great fun.
I like you; let's be friends!" Kalitan took
the boy's hand in his own rough one.</p>

<p>"Mahsie" (thank you), he said, a sudden
quick smile sweeping his dark face like a fleeting
sunbeam, but disappearing as quickly, leaving
it grave again. "Olo?" (hungry).</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Strong, "hungry and cold."</p>

<p>"Camp," said Kalitan, preparing to lead the
way, with the hospitality of his tribe, for the
Thlinkits are always ready to share food and
fire with any stranger. The two boys strode
off together, and Mr. Strong could scarcely
help smiling at the contrast between them.</p>

<p>Ted was the taller, but slim even in the furs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
which almost smothered him, leaving only his
bright face exposed to the wind and weather.
His hair was a tangle of yellow curls which no
parting could ever affect, for it stood straight
up from his forehead like a golden fleece; his
mother called it his aureole. His skin was fair
as a girl's, and his eyes as big and blue as a
young Viking's; but the Indian boy's locks
were black as ink, his skin was swarthy, his
eyes small and dark, and his features that
strange mixture of the Indian, the Esquimo,
and the Japanese which we often see in the best
of our Alaskan cousins.</p>

<p>Boys, however, are boys all the world over,
and friendly animals, and Ted was soon chattering
away to his newly found friend as if he had
known him all his life.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Kalitan," was the answer. "They call me
Kalitan Tenas;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> my father was Tyee."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>"Where is he?" asked Ted. He wanted to
see an Indian chief.</p>

<p>"Dead," said Kalitan, briefly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Ted. He adored his own
father, and felt it was hard on a boy not to
have one.</p>

<p>"He was killed," said Kalitan, "but we had
blood-money from them," he added, sternly.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Ted, curiously.</p>

<p>"Long time ago, when one man kill another,
his clan must pay with a life. One must be
found from his tribe to cry, 'O-o-o-o-o-a-ha-a-ich-klu-kuk-ich-klu-kuk'"
(ready to die,
ready to die). His voice wailed out the mournful
chant, which was weird and solemn and
almost made Ted shiver. "But now," the boy
went on, "Boston men" (Americans) "do not
like the blood-tax, so the murderer pays money
instead. We got many blankets and baskets
and moneys for Kalitan Tyee. He great chief."</p>

<p>"Do you live here?" asked Ted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, live on island out there." Kalitan
waved his hand seaward. "Come to fish with
my uncle, Klake Tyee. This good fishing-ground."</p>

<p>"It's a pretty fine country," said Ted, glancing
at the scene, which bore charm to other than
boyish eyes. To the east were the mountains
sheltering a valley through which the frozen
river wound like a silver ribbon, widening
toward the sea. A cold green glacier filled the
valley between two mountains with its peaks
of beauty. Toward the shore, which swept in
toward the river's mouth in a sheltered cove,
were clumps of trees, giant fir, aspen, and hemlock,
green and beautiful, while seaward swept
the waves in white-capped loveliness.</p>

<p>Kalitan ushered them to the camp with great
politeness and considerable pride.</p>

<p>"You've a good place to camp," said Mr.
Strong, "and we will gladly share your fire
until we are warm enough to go on."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Ted's face fell. "Must we go right away?"
he asked. "This is such a jolly place."</p>

<p>"No go to-day," said Kalitan, briefly, to
Chetwoof. "<i>Colesnass.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"Huh!" said Chetwoof. "Think some."</p>

<p>"Here comes my uncle," said Kalitan, and
he ran eagerly to meet an old Indian who came
toward the camp from the shore. He eagerly
explained the situation to the Tyee, who welcomed
the strangers with grave politeness. He
was an old man, with a seamed, scarred face,
but kindly eyes. Chief of the Thlinkits, his
tribe was scattered, his children dead, and Kalitan
about all left to him of interest in life.</p>

<p>"There will be more snow," he said to Mr.
Strong. "You are welcome. Stay and share
our fire and food."</p>

<p>"Do let us stay, father," cried Ted, and his
father smiled indulgently, but Kalitan looked
at him in astonishment. Alaskan boys are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
taught to hold their tongues and let their elders
decide matters, and Kalitan would never have
dreamed of teasing for anything.</p>

<p>But Mr. Strong did not wish to face another
snow-storm in the sledge, and knew he could
work but little till the storm was passed; so
he readily consented to stay a few days and let
Ted see some real Alaskan hunting and fishing.</p>

<p>Both boys were delighted, and soon had the
camp rearranged to accommodate the strangers.
The fire was built up, Ted and Kalitan gathering
cones and fir branches, which made a fragrant
blaze, while Chetwoof cared for the
dogs, and the old chief helped Mr. Strong pitch
his tent in the lee of some fragrant firs. Soon
all was prepared and supper cooking over the
coals,&mdash;a supper of fresh fish and seal fat,
which Alaskans consider a great delicacy, and
to which Mr. Strong added coffee and crackers
from his stores,&mdash;and Indians and whites ate
together in friendliness and amity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> does it happen that you speak English,
Kalitan?" asked Mr. Strong as they sat
around the camp-fire that evening. The snow
had continued during the afternoon, and the
boys had had an exciting time coasting and
snow-balling and enjoying themselves generally.</p>

<p>"I went for a few months to the Mission
School at Wrangel," said Kalitan. "I learned
much there. They teach the boys to read and
write and do sums and to work the ground besides.
They learn much more than the girls."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the old chief, grimly. "Girls
learn too much. They no good for Indian
wives, and white men not marry them. Best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for girls to stay at home at the will of their
fathers until they get husbands."</p>

<p>"So you've been in Wrangel," said Ted to
Kalitan. "We went there, too. It's a dandy
place. Do you remember the fringe of white
mountains back of the harbour? The people
said the woods were full of game, but we didn't
have time to go hunting. There are a few
shops there, but it seemed to me a very small
place to have been built since 1834. In the
States whole towns grow up in two or three
weeks."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Kalitan, with a quick shrug
of his shoulders, "quick grow, sun fade and
wind blow down."</p>

<p>"I don't think the sun could ever fade in
Wrangel," laughed Ted. "They told me there
it hadn't shone but fifteen days in three months.
It rained all the time."</p>

<p>"Rain is nothing," said Kalitan. "It is
when the Ice Spirit speaks in the North Wind's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
roar and in the crackling of the floes that we
tremble. The glaciers are the children of the
Mountain Spirit whom our fathers worshipped.
He is angry, and lo! he hurls down icebergs
in his wrath, he tosses them about, upon the
streams he tosses the <i>kyaks</i> like feathers and
washes the land with the waves of Sitth. When
our people are buried in the ground instead of
being burnt with the fire, they must go for ever
to the place of Sitth, of everlasting cold, where
never sun abides, nor rain, nor warmth."</p>

<p>Ted had listened spellbound to this poetic
speech and gazed at Kalitan in open-mouthed
amazement. A boy who could talk like that
was a new and delightful playmate, and he
said:</p>

<p>"Tell me more about things, Kalitan," but
the Indian was silent, ashamed of having
spoken.</p>

<p>"What do you do all day when you are at
home?" persisted the American.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"In winter there is nothing to do but to
hunt and fish," said Kalitan. "Sometimes we
do not find much game, then we think of how,
when a Thlinkit dies, he has plenty. If he has
lived as a good tribesman, his kyak glides
smoothly over the silver waters into the sunset,
until, o'er gently flowing currents, it reaches
the place of the mighty forest. A bad warrior's
canoe passes dark whirlpools and terrible
rapids until he reaches the place we speak not
of, where reigns Sitth.</p>

<p>"In the summer-time we still hunt and fish.
Many have learned to till the ground, and we
gather berries and wood for the winter. The
other side of the inlet, the tree-trunks drift
from the Yukon and are stranded on the islands,
so there is plenty for firewood. But upon our
island the women gather a vine and dry it.
They collect seaweed for food in the early
spring, and dry it and press it into square cakes,
which make good food after they have hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
long in the sun. They make baskets and sell
them to the white people. Often my uncle and
I take them to Valdez, and once we brought
back fifty dollars for those my mother made.
There is always much to do."</p>

<p>"Don't you get terribly cold hunting in the
winter?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Thlinkit boy not a baby," said Kalitan, a
trifle scornfully. "We begin to be hardened
when we are babies. When I was five years
old, I left my father and went to my uncle to
be taught. Every morning I bathed in the
ocean, even if I had to break ice to find water,
and then I rolled in the snow. After that my
uncle brushed me with a switch bundle, and
not lightly, for his arm is strong. I must not
cry out, no matter if he hurt, for a chief's son
must never show pain nor fear. That would
give his people shame."</p>

<p>"Don't you get sick?" asked Ted, who felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cold all over at the idea of being treated in such
a heroic manner.</p>

<p>"The <i>Kooshta</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> comes sometimes," said
Kalitan. "The Shaman<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> used to cast him out,
but now the white doctor can do it, unless the
<i>kooshta</i> is too strong."</p>

<p>Ted was puzzled as to Kalitan's exact meaning,
but did not like to ask too many questions
for fear of being impolite, so he only said:</p>

<p>"Being sick is not very nice, anyhow."</p>

<p>"To be bewitched is the most terrible," said
Kalitan, gravely.</p>

<p>"How does that happen?" asked Ted,
eagerly, but Kalitan shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is not good to hear," he said. "The
medicine-man must come with his drum and
rattle, and he is very terrible. If the white
men will not allow any more the punishing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the witches, they should send more of the white
medicine-men, if we are not to have any more
of our own."</p>

<p>"Boys should not talk about big things,"
said the old chief suddenly. He had been sitting
quietly over the fire, and spoke so suddenly
that Kalitan collapsed into silence. Ted, too,
quieted down at the old chief's stern voice and
manner, and both boys sat and listened to the
men talking, while the snow still swirled about
them.</p>

<p>Tyee Klake told Mr. Strong many interesting
things about the coast country, and gave
him valuable information as to the route he
should pursue in his search for interesting
things in the mountains.</p>

<p>"It will be two weeks before the snow will
break so you can travel in comfort," he said.
"Camp with us. We remain here one week,
then we go to the island. We can take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
there, you will see many things, and your boy
will hunt with Kalitan."</p>

<p>"Where is your island?" asked Mr. Strong.</p>

<p>Ted said nothing, but his eyes were fixed
eagerly upon his father. It was easy to see that
he wished to accept the invitation.</p>

<p>"Out there." Tyee Klake pointed toward
where the white coast-line seemed to fade into
silvery blue.</p>

<p>"There are many islands; on some lives
no one, but we have a village. Soon it will be
nearly deserted, for many of our people rove
during the summer, and wander from one camping-ground
to another, seeking the best game
or fish. But Kalitan's people remain always on
the island. Him I take with me to hunt the
whale and seal, to gather the berries, and to
trap the little animals who bear fur. We find
even seal upon our shores, though fewer since
your people have come among us."</p>

<p>"Which were the best, Russians or Americans?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
asked Mr. Strong, curious to see what
the old Indian would say, but the Tyee was not
to be caught napping.</p>

<p>"Men all alike," he said. "Thlinkit, Russian,
American, some good, some bad. Russians
used Indians more, gave them hunting
and fishing, and only took part of the skins.
Americans like to hunt and fish all themselves
and leave nothing for the Indians. Russians
teach <i>quass</i>, Americans teach whiskey. Before
white men came, Indians were healthy. They
ate fish, game, berries; now they must have
other foods, and they are not good for Indians
here,"&mdash;he touched his stomach. "Indian
used to dress in skins and furs, now he must
copy white man and shiver with cold. He soon
has the coughing sickness and then he goes into
the unknown.</p>

<p>"But the government of the Americans is
best because it tries to do some things for the
Indian. It teaches our boys useful things in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the schools, and, if some of its people are bad,
some Indians are bad, too. Men all alike,"
he repeated with the calm stoicism of his race.</p>

<p>"The government is far away," said Mr.
Strong, "and should not be blamed for the
doings of all its servants. I should like to see
this island home of yours, and think we must
accept your invitation; shall we, Ted?" he
smiled at the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; thank you, sir," said Ted,
and he and Kalitan grinned at each other happily.</p>

<p>"We shall stay in camp until the blue jay
comes," said the old chief, smiling, "and then
seek the village of my people."</p>

<p>"What does the blue jay mean?" asked Ted,
timidly, for he was very much in awe of this
grave old man.</p>

<p>Kalitan said something in Thlinkit to his
uncle, and the old chief, looking kindly at the
boy, replied with a nod:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you the story of the blue jay,"
he said.</p>

<p>"My story is of the far, far north. Beside
a salmon stream there dwelt people rich in
slaves. These caught and dried the salmon for
the winter, and nothing is better to eat than
dried salmon dipped in seal oil. All the fish
were caught and stored away, when lo! the
whiteness fell from heaven and the snows were
upon them. It was the time of snow and they
should not have complained, but the chief was
evil and he cursed the whiteness. No one
should dare to speak evil of the Snow Spirit,
which comes from the Unknown! Deeper and
deeper grew the snow. It flew like feathers
about the <i>eglu</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the slaves had many troubles
in putting in limbs for the fire. Then the
snow came in flakes so large they seemed like
the wings of birds, and the house was covered,
and they could no longer keep their <i>kyaks</i> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
top of the snow. All were shut tight in the
house, and their fire and food ran low. They
knew not how many days they were shut in,
for there was no way to tell the day from night,
only they knew they were sore hungry and that
the Snow Spirit was angry and terrible in his
anger.</p>

<p>"But each one spoke not; he only chose a
place where he should lie down and die when
he could bear no more.</p>

<p>"Only the chief spoke, and he once. 'Snow
Spirit,' he said aloud, 'I alone am evil. These
are not so. Slay me and spare!' But the Snow
Spirit answered not, only the wind screamed
around the <i>eglu</i>, and his screams were terrible
and sad. Then hope left the heart of the chief
and he prepared to die with all his people and
all his slaves.</p>

<p>"But on the day when their last bit of food
was gone, lo! something pecked at the top of
the smoke-hole, and it sang 'Nuck-tee,' and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was a blue jay. The chief heard and saw and
wondered, and, looking 'neath the smoke-hole,
he saw a scarlet something upon the floor.
Picking it up, he found it was a bunch of Indian
tomato berries, red and ripe, and quickly
hope sprang in his breast.</p>

<p>"'Somewhere is summer,' he cried. 'Let
us up and away.'</p>

<p>"Then the slaves hastened to dig out the
canoe, and they drew it with mighty labour,
for they were weak from fasting, over the
snows to the shore, and there they launched
it without sail or paddle, with all the people
rejoicing. And after a time the wind carried
them to a beach where all was summer. Birds
sang, flowers bloomed, and berries gleamed
scarlet in the sun, and there were salmon jumping
in the blue water. They ate and were satisfied,
for it was summer on the earth and summer
in their hearts.</p>

<p>"That is how the Thlinkits came to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
island, and so we say when the snow breaks,
that now comes the blue jay."</p>

<p>"Thank you for telling us such a dandy
story," cried Ted, who had not lost a word of
this quaint tale, told so graphically over the
camp-fire of the old chief Klake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TO THE GLACIER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> slept soundly all night, wrapped in the
bearskins from the sledge, in the little tent he
shared with his father. When the morning
broke, he sprang to his feet and hurried out
of doors, hopeful for the day's pleasures. The
snow had stopped, but the ground was covered
with a thick white pall, and the mountains were
turned to rose colour in the morning sun, which
was rising in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Kalitan," shouted Ted to
his Indian friend, whom he spied heaping wood
upon the camp-fire. "Isn't it dandy? What
can we do to-day?"</p>

<p>"Have breakfast," said Kalitan, briefly.
"Then do what Tyee says."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I hope he'll say something exciting,"
said Ted.</p>

<p>"Think good day to hunt," said Kalitan, as
he prepared things for the morning meal.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the fish?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Broke ice-hole and fished when I got up,"
said the Thlinkit.</p>

<p>"You don't mean you have been fishing
already," exclaimed the lazy Ted, and Kalitan
smiled as he said:</p>

<p>"White people like fish. Tyee said: 'Catch
fish for Boston men's breakfast,' and I go."</p>

<p>"Do you always mind him like that?" asked
Ted. He generally obeyed his father, but there
were times when he wasn't anxious to and argued
a little about it. Kalitan looked at him
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"He chief!" he said, simply.</p>

<p>"What will we do with the camp if we all
go hunting?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Kalitan.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave Chetwoof to watch, I suppose," continued
Ted.</p>

<p>"Watch? Why?" asked Kalitan.</p>

<p>"Why, everything; some one will steal our
things," said Ted.</p>

<p>"Thlinkits not steal," said Kalitan, with dignity.
"Maybe white man come along and steal
from his brothers; Indians not. If we go away
to long hunt, we <i>cache</i> blankets and no one
would touch."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by <i>cache</i>?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"We build a mound hut near the house, and
put there the blankets and stores. Sometime
they stay there for years, but no one would take
from a <i>cache</i>. If one has plenty of wood by
the seashore or in the forest, he may cord it and
go his way and no one will touch it. A deer
hangs on a tree where dogs may not reach it,
but no stray hunter would slice even a piece.
We are not thieves."</p>

<p>"It is a pity you could not send missionaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to the States, you Thlinkits, my boy," said Mr.
Strong, who had come up in time to hear Kalitan's
words. "I'm afraid white people are less
honest."</p>

<p>"Teddy, do you know we are to have some
hunting to-day, and that you'll get your first
experience with a glacier."</p>

<p>"Hurrah," shouted Ted, dancing up and
down in excitement.</p>

<p>"Tyee Klake says we can hunt toward the
base of the glacier, and I shall try to go a little
ways upon it and see how the land lies, or,
rather, the ice. It is getting warmer, and, if
it continues a few days, the snow will melt
enough to let us go over to that island you are
so anxious to see."</p>

<p>Ted's eyes shone, and the amount of breakfast
he put away quite prepared him for his
day's work, which, pleasant though it might be,
certainly was hard work. The chief said they
must seek the glacier first before the sun got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hot, for it was blinding on the snow. So they
set out soon after breakfast, leaving Chetwoof
in charge of the camp, and with orders to catch
enough fish for dinner.</p>

<p>"We'll be ready to eat them, heads and
tails," said Ted, and his father added, laughingly:</p>

<p>"'Bible, bones, and hymn-book, too.'"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Ted, as
Kalitan looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Once a writer named Macaulay said he
could make a rhyme for any word in the English
language, and a man replied, 'You can't
rhyme Timbuctoo.' But he answered without
a pause:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If I were a Cassowary<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the plains of Timbuctoo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'd eat up a missionary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bible, bones, and hymn-book, too."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Ted laughed, but Kalitan said, grimly:</p>

<p>"Not good to eat Boston missionary, he
all skin and bone!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did they get the name Alaska?"
asked Ted, as they tramped over the snow
toward the glacier.</p>

<p>"Al-ay-ck-sa&mdash;great country," said Kalitan.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," said Ted. "It's fine! I
never saw anything like this at home," pointing
as he spoke to the scene in front of him.</p>

<p>A group of evergreen trees, firs and the
Alaska spruce, so useful for fires and torches,
fringed the edge of the ice-field, green and verdant
in contrast to the gleaming snows of the
mountain, which rose in a gentle slope at first,
then precipitously, in a dazzling and enchanting
combination of colour. It was as if some marble
palace of old rose before them against the
heavens, for the ice was cut and serrated into
spires and gables, turrets and towers, all seeming
to be ornamented with fretwork where the
sun's rays struck the peaks and turned them
into silver and gold. Lower down the ice
looked like animals, so twisted was it into fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shapes; fierce sea monsters with yawning
mouths seeming ready to devour; bears and
wolves, whales, gigantic elephants, and snowy
tigers, tropic beasts looking strangely out of
place in this arctic clime.</p>

<p>Deep crevices cut the ice-fields, and in their
green-blue depths lurked death, for the least
misstep would dash the traveller into an abyss
which had no bottom. Beyond the glacier itself,
the snow-capped mountains rose grand and
serene, their glittering peaks clear against the
blue sky, which hue the glacier reflected and
played with in a thousand glinting shades, from
purpling amethyst to lapis lazuli and turquoise.</p>

<p>As they gazed spellbound, a strange thing occurred,
a thing of such wonder and beauty that
Ted could but grasp his father's arm in silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly the peaks seemed to melt away, the
white ice-pinnacles became real turrets, houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and cathedrals appeared, and before them arose
a wonderful city of white marble, dream-like
and shadowy, but beautiful as Aladdin's palace
in the "Arabian Nights." At last Ted could
keep silent no longer.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried, and the old chief
answered, gravely:</p>

<p>"The City of the Dead," but his father
said:</p>

<p>"A mirage, my boy. They are often seen
in these regions, but you are fortunate in seeing
one of the finest I have ever witnessed."</p>

<p>"What is a mirage?" demanded Ted.</p>

<p>"An optical delusion," said his father, "and
one I am sure I couldn't explain so that you
would understand it. The queer thing about
a mirage is that you usually see the very thing
most unlikely to be found in that particular
locality. In the Sahara, men see flowers and
trees and fountains, and here on this glacier we
see a splendid city."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"It certainly is queer. What makes glaciers,
daddy?" Ted was even more interested than
usual in his father's talk because of Kalitan,
whose dark eyes never left Mr. Strong's face,
and who seemed to drink in every word of
information as eagerly as a thirsty bird drinks
water.</p>

<p>"The dictionaries tell you that glaciers are
fields of ice, or snow and ice, formed in the
regions of perpetual snow, and moving slowly
down the mountain slopes or valleys. Many
people say the glaciers are the fathers of the
icebergs which float at sea, and that these are
broken off the glacial stream, but others deny
this. When the glacial ice and snow reaches
a point where the air is so warm that the ice
melts as fast as it is pushed down from above,
the glacier ends and a river begins. These are
the finest glaciers in the world, except, perhaps,
those of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>"This bids fair to be a wonderfully interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
place for my work, Ted, and I'm glad
you're likely to be satisfied with your new
friends, for I shall have to go to many places
and do a lot of things less interesting than the
things Kalitan can show you.</p>

<p>"See these blocks of fine marble and those
superb masses of porphyry and chalcedony,&mdash;but
there's something which will interest you
more. Take my gun and see if you can't bring
down a bird for supper."</p>

<p>Wild ducks were flying low across the edge
of the glacier and quite near to the boys, and
Ted grasped his father's gun in wild excitement.
He was never allowed to touch a gun
at home. Dearly as he loved his mother, it had
always seemed very strange to him that she
should show such poor taste about firearms,
and refuse to let him have any; and now that
he had a gun really in his hands, he could hardly
hold it, he was so excited. Of course it was not
the first time, for his father had allowed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to practise shooting at a mark ever since they
had reached Alaska, but this was the first time
he had tried to shoot a living target. He selected
his duck, aimed quickly, and fired. Bang!
Off went the gun, and, wonder of wonders!
two ducks fell instead of one.</p>

<p>"Well done, Ted, that duck was twins,"
cried his father, laughing, almost as excited as
the boy himself, and they ran to pick up the
birds. Kalitan smiled, too, and quietly picked
up one, saying:</p>

<p>"This one Kalitan's," showing, as he spoke,
his arrow through the bird's side, for he had
discharged an arrow as Ted fired his gun.</p>

<p>"Too bad, Ted. I thought you were a
mighty hunter, a Nimrod who killed two birds
with one stone," said Mr. Strong, but Ted
laughed and said:</p>

<p>"So I got the one I shot at, I don't care."</p>

<p>They had wild duck at supper that night, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Chetwoof plucked the birds and roasted them
on a hot stone over the spruce logs, and Ted,
tired and wet and hungry, thought he had never
tasted such a delicious meal in his life.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TED MEETS MR. BRUIN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed to Ted as if he had scarcely
touched the pillow on the nights which followed
before it was daylight, and he would awake to
find the sun streaming in at his tent flap. He
always meant to go fishing with Kalitan before
breakfast, so the moment he woke up he jumped
out of bed, if his pile of fragrant pine boughs
covered with skins could be called a bed, and
hurried through his toilet. Quick as he tried
to be, however, he was never ready before Kalitan,
for, when Ted appeared, the Indian boy
had always had his roll in the snow and was
preparing his lines.</p>

<p>Kalitan was perfectly fascinated with the
American boy. He thought him the most wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
specimen of a boy that he had ever seen.
He knew so much that Kalitan did not, and
talked so brightly that being with Ted was to
the Indian like having a book without the
bother of reading. There were some things
about him that Kalitan could not understand,
to be sure. Ted talked to his father just as if
he were another boy. He even spoke to Tyee
Klake on occasions when that august personage
had not only not asked him a question, but was
not speaking at all. From the Thlinkit point
of view, this was a most remarkable performance
on Ted's part, but Kalitan thought it must
be all right for a "Boston boy," for even the
stern old chief seemed to regard happy-go-lucky
Ted with approval.</p>

<p>Ted, on the other hand, thought Kalitan the
most remarkable boy he had ever met in all his
life. He had not been much with boys. His
"Lady Mother," as he always called the gentle,
brown-eyed being who ruled his father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
himself, had not cared to have her little Galahad
mingle with the rougher city boys who
thronged the streets, and had kept him with
herself a great deal. Ted had loved books, and
he and his little sister Judith had lived in a
pleasant atmosphere of refinement, playing happily
together until the boy had grown almost
to dread anything common or low. His mother
knew he had moral courage, and would face
any issue pluckily, but his father feared he
would grow up a milksop, and thought he
needed hardening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Strong objected to the hardening process
if it consisted in turning her boy loose to
learn the ways of the city streets, but had consented
to his going with his father, urged
thereto by fears for his health, which was not of
the best, and the knowledge that he had reached
the "bear and Indian" age, and it was certainly
a good thing for him to have his experiences
first-hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>To Ted the whole thing was perfectly delightful.
When he lay down at night, he
would often like to see "Mother and Ju," but
he was generally so tired that he was asleep
before he had time to think enough to be really
homesick. During the day there was too much
doing to have any thinking time, and, since he
had met this boy friend, he thought of little
else but him and what they were to do next.
The Tyee had assured Mr. Strong that it was
perfectly safe for the boys to go about together.</p>

<p>"Kalitan knows all the trails," he said.
"He take care of white brother. Anything
come, call Chetwoof."</p>

<p>As Mr. Strong was very anxious to penetrate
the glacier under Klake's guidance, and wanted
Ted to enjoy himself to the full, he left the boys
to themselves, the only stipulation being that
they should not go on the water without Chetwoof.</p>

<p>There seemed to be always something new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to do. As the days grew warmer, the ice broke
in the river, and the boys tramped all over the
country. Ted learned to use the bow and arrow,
and brought down many a bird for supper,
and proud he was when he served up for
his father a wild duck, shot, plucked, and
cooked all by himself.</p>

<p>They fished in the stream by day and set
lines by night. They trapped rabbits and hares
in the woods, and one day even got a silver fox,
a skin greatly prized by the fur traders on
account of its rarity. Kalitan insisted that Ted
should have it, though he could have gotten
forty dollars for it from a white trader, and Ted
was rejoiced at the idea of taking it home to
make a set of furs for Judith.</p>

<p>One day Ted had a strange experience, and
not a very pleasant one, which might have been
very serious had it not been for Kalitan. He
had noticed a queer-looking plant on the river-bank
the day before, and had stopped to pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it up, when he received such a sudden and unexpected
pricking as to cause him to jump back
and shout for Kalitan. His hand felt as if it
had been pierced by a thousand needles, and he
flew to a snow-bank to rub it with snow.</p>

<p>"I must have gotten hold of some kind of
a cactus," he said to Kalitan, who only replied:</p>

<p>"Huh! picked hedgehog," as he pointed to
where Ted's cactus was ambling indignantly
away with every quill rattling and set straight
out in anger at having his morning nap disturbed.
Kalitan wrapped Ted's hand in soft
mud, which took the pain out, but he couldn't
use it much for the next few days, and did not
feel eager to hunt when his father and the Tyee
started out in the morning. Kalitan remained
with him, although his eyes looked wistful, for
he had heard the chief talk about bear tracks
having been seen the day before. Bears were
quite a rarity, but sometimes an old cinnamon
or even a big black bruin would venture down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in search of fresh fish, which he would catch
cleverly with his great paws.</p>

<p>Kalitan and Ted fished awhile, and then Ted
wandered away a little, wondering what lay
around a point of rock which he had never yet
explored. Something lay there which he had
by no means expected to see, and he scarcely
knew what to make of it. On the river-bank,
close to the edge of the stream, was a black
figure, an Indian fishing, as he supposed, and
he paused to watch. The fisherman was covered
with fur from head to foot, and, as Ted
watched him, he seemed to have no line or rod.
Going nearer, the boy grew even more puzzled,
and, though the man's back was toward him,
he could easily see that there was something unusual
about the figure. Just as he was within
hailing distance and about to shout, the figure
made a quick dive toward the water and sprang
back again with a fish between his paws, and
Ted saw that it was a huge bear. He gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
sharp cry and then stood stock-still. The creature
looked around and stood gnawing his fish
and staring at Ted as stupidly as the boy stared
at him. Then Ted heard a halloo behind him
and Kalitan's voice:</p>

<p>"Run for Chetwoof, quick!"</p>

<p>Ted obeyed as the animal started to move
off. He ran toward the camp, hearing the report
of Kalitan's gun as he ran. Chetwoof,
hearing the noise, hurried out, and it was but
a few moments before he was at Kalitan's side.
To Ted it seemed like a day before he could
get back and see what was happening, but he
arrived on the scene in time to see Chetwoof
despatch the animal.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Ted. "You've killed a
bear," but Chetwoof only grunted crossly.</p>

<p>"Very bad luck!" he said, and Kalitan explained:</p>

<p>"Indians don't like to kill bears or ravens.
Spirits in them, maybe ancestors."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Ted looked at him in great astonishment,
but Kalitan explained:</p>

<p>"Once, long ago, a Thlinkit girl laughed at
a bear track in the snow and said: 'Ugly animal
must have made that track!' But a bear heard
and was angry. He seized the maiden and bore
her to his den, and turned her into a bear, and
she dwelt with him, until one day her brother
killed the bear and she was freed. And from
that day Thlinkits speak respectfully of bears,
and do not try to kill them, for they know not
whether it is a bear or a friend who hides
within the shaggy skin."</p>

<p>The Tyee and Mr. Strong were greatly surprised
when they came home to see the huge
carcass of Mr. Bruin, and they listened to the
account of Kalitan's bravery. The old chief
said little, but he looked approvingly at Kalitan,
and said "Hyas kloshe" (very good),
which unwonted praise made the boy's face
glow with pleasure. They had a great discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as to whom the bear really belonged. Ted
had found him, Kalitan had shot him first, and
Chetwoof had killed him, so they decided to
go shares. Ted wanted the skin to take home,
and thought it would make a splendid rug for
his mother's library, so his father paid Kalitan
and Chetwoof what each would have received
as their share had the skin been sold to a trader,
and they all had bear meat for supper. Ted
thought it finer than any beefsteak he had ever
eaten, and over it Kalitan smacked his lips audibly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A MONSTER OF THE DEEP</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> big bear occupied considerable attention
for several days. He had to be carefully
skinned and part of the meat dried for future
use. Alaskans never use salt for preserving
meat. Indeed they seem to dislike salt very
much. It had taken Ted some time to learn
to eat all his meat and fish quite fresh, without
a taste of salt, but he had grown to like it.
There is something in the sun and wind of
Alaska which cures meat perfectly, and the
bear's meat was strung on sticks and dried in
the sun so that they might enjoy it for a long
time.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the adventure with Bruin was
enough to last the boys for several days, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Ted's hand still pained him from the porcupine's
quills, and he felt tired and lazy. He lay
by the camp-fire one afternoon listening to Kalitan's
tales of his island home, when his father
came in from a long tramp, and, looking at
him a little anxiously, asked:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, son?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I'm only tired," said Ted, but
Kalitan said:</p>

<p>"Porcupine quills poison hand. Well in a
few days."</p>

<p>"So your live cactus is getting in his work,
is he? I'm glad it wasn't the bear you mistook
for an Alaskan posy and tried to pick. I'm
tired myself," and Mr. Strong threw himself
down to rest.</p>

<p>"Daddy, how did we come to have Alaska,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a long story," said his father,
"but an interesting one."</p>

<p>"Do tell us about it," urged Ted. "I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
we bought it, but what did we pay the Indians
for it? I shouldn't have thought they'd have
sold such a fine country."</p>

<p>Kalitan looked up quickly, and there was a
sudden gleam in his dark eyes that Ted had
never seen before.</p>

<p>"Thlinkits never sell," he said. "Russians
steal."</p>

<p>Mr. Strong put his hand kindly on the boy's
head.</p>

<p>"You're right, Kalitan," he said. "The
Russians never conquered the Thlinkits, the
bravest tribe in all Alaska.</p>

<p>"You see, Teddy, it was this way. A great
many years ago, about 1740, a Danish sailor
named Bering, who was in the service of the
Russians, sailed across the ocean and discovered
the strait named for him, and a number of
islands. Some of these were not inhabited,
others had Indians or Esquimos on them, but,
after the manner of the early discoverers, Bering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
took possession of them all in the name of
the Emperor of Russia. It doesn't seem right
as we look at things now, but in those days
'might made right,' and it was just the same
way the English did when they came to America.</p>

<p>"The Russians settled here, finding the fishing
and furs fine things for trade, and driving
the Indians, who would not yield to them, farther
and farther inland. In 1790 the Czar
made Alexander Baranoff manager of the trading
company. Baranoff established trading-posts
in various places, and settled at Sitka,
where you can see the ruins of the splendid
castle he built. The Russians also sent missionaries
to convert the Indians to the Greek
Church, which is the church of Russia. The
Indians, however, never learned to care for the
Russians, and often were cruelly treated by
them. The Russians, however, tried to do
something for their education, and established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
several schools. One as early as 1775, on Kadiak
Island, had thirty pupils, who studied
arithmetic, reading, navigation, and four of the
mechanical trades, and this is a better record
than the American purchasers can show, I am
sorry to say.</p>

<p>"One of the recent travellers<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in Alaska
says that he met in the country 'American citizens
who never in their lives heard a prayer for
the President of the United States, nor of the
Fourth of July, nor the name of the capital of
the nation, but who have been taught to pray
for the Emperor of Russia, to celebrate his
birthday, and to commemorate the victories of
ancient Greece.' In March, 1867, the Russians
sold Alaska to the United States for $7,200,000
in gold. It was bought for a song almost,
when we consider the immense amount of
money made for the government by the seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
fisheries, the cod and salmon industries, and the
opening of the gold fields. The resources of the
country are not half-known, and the government
is beginning to see this. That is one of
the reasons they have sent me here, with the
other men, to find out what the earth holds for
those who do not know how to look for its
treasures. Gold is not the best thing the earth
produces. There is land in Alaska little known
full of coal and other useful minerals. Other
land is covered with magnificent timber which
could be shipped to all parts of the world.
There are pasture-lands where stock will fatten
like pigs without any other feeding; there are
fertile soils which will raise almost any crops,
and there are intelligent Indians who can be
taught to work and be useful members of society.
I do not mean dragged off to the United
States to learn things they could never use in
their home lives, but who should be educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
here to make the best of their talents in their
home surroundings.</p>

<p>"That is one crying shame to our government,
that they have neglected the Alaskan citizens.
Forty years have been wasted, but we
are beginning to wake up now, and twenty
years more will see the Indians of Kalitan's generation
industrious men and women, not only
clever hunters and fishermen, but lumbermen,
coopers, furniture makers, farmers, miners, and
stock-raisers."</p>

<p>At this moment their quiet conversation was
interrupted by a wild shout from the shore,
and, springing to their feet, they saw Chetwoof
gesticulating wildly and shouting to the Tyee,
who had been mending his canoe by the river-bank.
Kalitan dropped everything and ran
without a word, scudding like the arrow from
which he took his name. Before Ted could
follow or ask what was the matter, from the
ocean a huge body rose ten feet out of the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
spouting jets of spray twenty feet into the air,
the sun striking his sides and turning them to
glistening silver. Then it fell back, the waters
churning into frothy foam for a mile around.</p>

<p>"It's a whale, Ted, sure as you live. Luck
certainly is coming your way," said his father;
but, at the word "whale," Ted had started
after Kalitan, losing no time in getting to the
scene of action as fast as possible.</p>

<p>"Watch the Tyee!" called Kalitan over his
shoulder, as both boys ran down to the water's
edge.</p>

<p>The old chief was launching his <i>kiak</i> into
the seething waters, and to Ted it seemed incredible
that he meant to go in that frail bark
in pursuit of the mighty monster. The old
man's face, however, was as calm as though
starting on a pleasure-trip in peaceful waters,
and Ted watched in breathless admiration to
see what would happen next.</p>

<p>Klake paddled swiftly out to sea, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as near as he dared to where the huge monster
splashed idly up and down like a great puppy
at play. He stopped the <i>kiak</i> and watched;
then poised his spear and threw it, and so swift
and graceful was his gesture that Ted exclaimed
in amazement.</p>

<p>"Tyee Klake best harpoon-thrower of all the
Thlinkits," said Kalitan, proudly. "Watch!"</p>

<p>Ted needed no such instructions. His keen
eyes passed from fish to man and back again,
and no movement of the Tyee escaped him.</p>

<p>The instant the harpoon was thrown, the
Tyee paddled furiously away, for when a harpoon
strikes a whale, he is likely to lash violently
with his tail, and may destroy his enemy,
and this is a moment of terrible danger to the
harpooner. But the whale was too much astonished
to fight, and, with a terrific splash, he
dived deep, deep into the water, to get rid of
that stinging thing in his side, in the cold green
waters below.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="355" height="500" alt="Throwing a harpoon from a kayak, surrounded by floating ice" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AWAY WENT ANOTHER STINGING LANCE.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>The Tyee waited, his grim face tense and
earnest. It might have been fifteen minutes,
for whales often stay under water for twenty
minutes before coming to the surface to breathe,
but to Kalitan and Ted it seemed an hour.</p>

<p>Then the spray dashed high into the air
again, and the instant the huge body appeared,
Klake drew near, and away went another stinging
lance again, swift and, oh! so sure of aim.
This time the whale struck out wildly, and Kalitan
held his breath, while Ted gasped at the
Tyee's danger, for his <i>kiak</i> rocked like a shell
and then was quite hidden from their sight by
the spray which was dashed heavenward like
clouds of white smoke.</p>

<p>Once more the creature dived, and this time
he stayed down only a few minutes, and, when
he came up, blood spouted into the air and dyed
the sea crimson, and Kalitan exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Pierced his lungs! Now he must die."</p>

<p>There was one more bright, glancing weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
flying through the air, and Ted noticed attached
to it by a thong a curious-looking bulb, and
asked Kalitan:</p>

<p>"What is on that lance?"</p>

<p>"Sealskin buoy," said Kalitan. "We make
the bag and blow it up, tie it to the harpoon,
and when the lance sticks into the whale, the
buoy makes it very hard for him to dive. After
awhile he dies and drifts ashore."</p>

<p>The waters about the whale were growing
red, and the carcass seemed drifting out to sea,
and at last the Tyee seemed satisfied. He sent
a last look toward the huge body, then turned
his <i>kiak</i> toward the watchers on the banks.</p>

<p>"If it only comes to shore," said Kalitan.</p>

<p>"What will you do with it?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are lots of things we can do with
a whale," said Kalitan. "The blubber is the
best thing to eat in all the world. Then we use
the oil in a bowl with a bit of pith in it to light
our huts. The bones are all useful in building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
our houses. Whales were once bears, but they
played too much on the shore and ran away to
sea, so they wore off all their fur on the rocks,
and had their feet nibbled off by the fishes."</p>

<p>"Well, this one didn't have his tail nibbled
off at any rate," laughed Ted. "I saw it flap
at the Tyee, and thought that was the last of
him, sure."</p>

<p>"Tyee much big chief," said Kalitan, and
just then the old man's <i>kiak</i> drew near them,
and he stepped ashore as calmly as though he
had not just been through so exciting a scene
with a mighty monster of the deep.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ISLAND HOME OF KALITAN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span> and even were the strokes of the paddles
as the canoes sped over the water toward
Kalitan's island home. Ted was so excited that
he could hardly sit still, and Tyee Klake gave
him a warning glance and a muttered "Kooletchika."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The day before a big canoe had come to the
camp, the paddlers bearing messages for the
Tyee, and he had had a long conversation with
Mr. Strong. The result was astonishing to
Teddy, for his father told him that he was to
go for a month to the island with Kalitan.
This delighted him greatly, but he was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
frightened when he found that his father was
to stay behind.</p>

<p>"It's just this way, son," Mr. Strong explained
to him. "I'm here in government employ,
taking government pay to do government
work. I must do it and do it well in the shortest
time possible. You will have a far better
time on the island with Kalitan than you could
possibly have loafing around the camp here.
You couldn't go to many places where I am
going, and, if my mind is easy about you, I can
take Chetwoof and do my work in half the
time. I'll come to the island in three or four
weeks, and we'll take a week's vacation together,
and then we'll hit the trail for the gold-fields.
Are you satisfied with this arrangement?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Ted's tone was dubious, but
his face soon cleared up. "A month won't be
very long, father."</p>

<p>"No, I'll wager you'll be sorry to leave when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I come for you. Try and not make any trouble.
Of course Indian ways are not ours, but you'll
get used to it all and enjoy it. It's a chance
most boys would be crazy over, and you'll have
tales to tell when you get home to make your
playmates envy you. I'm glad I have a son
I can trust to keep straight when he is out of
my sight," and he laid his hand affectionately
on the boy's shoulder. Ted looked his father
squarely in the eye, but gave only a little nod
in answer, then he laughed his clear, ringing
laugh.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't mother have spasms!" he exclaimed.
Mr. Strong laughed too, but said:</p>

<p>"You'll be just as well off tumbling around
with Kalitan as falling off a glacier or two, as
you would be certain to do if you were with
me."</p>

<p>Teddy felt a little blue when he said good-bye
to his father, but Kalitan quickly dispelled
his gloom by a great piece of news.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great time on island," he said, as the canoe
glided toward the dim outline of land to which
Ted's thoughts had so often turned. "Tyee's
whale came ashore. We go to see him cut
up."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Ted, delighted. "To
think I shall see all that! What else will we
do, Kalitan?"</p>

<p>"Hunt, fish, hear old Kala-kash stories. See
berry dance if you stay long enough, perhaps a
potlatch; do many things," said the Indian.</p>

<p>One of the Indian paddlers said something
to Kalitan, and he laughed a little, and Ted
asked, curiously: "What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Said Kalitan Tenas learned to talk as much
as a Boston boy," said Kalitan, laughing heartily,
and Ted laughed, too.</p>

<p>The canoes were nearing the shore of a
wooded island, and Ted saw a fringe of trees
and some native houses clustered picturesquely
against them at the crest of a small hill which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sloped down to the water's edge, where stood a
group of people awaiting the canoes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/i087.jpg" width="357" height="500" alt="People waiting in front of a small cabin" />
<span class="caption">&quot;A GROUP OF PEOPLE AWAITING THE CANOES.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"My home," said Kalitan, pointing to the
largest house, "my people." There was a
great deal of pride in his tone and look, and
he received a warm welcome as the canoes
touched land and their occupants sprang on
shore. The boys crowded around the young
Indian and chattered and gesticulated toward
Ted, while a bright-looking little Malamute
sprang upon Kalitan and nearly knocked him
down, covering his face with eager puppy
kisses.</p>

<p>The girls were less boisterous, and regarded
Teddy with shy curiosity. Some of them were
quite pretty, and the babies were as cunning as
the puppies. They barked every time the dogs
did, in a funny, hoarse little way, and, indeed,
Alaskan babies learn to bark long before they
learn to talk.</p>

<p>The Tyee's wife received Teddy kindly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he soon found himself quite at home among
these hospitable people, who seemed always
friendly and natural. Nearly all spoke some
English, and he rapidly added to his store of
Chinook, so that he had no trouble in making
himself understood or in understanding. Of
course he missed his father, but he had little time
to be lonely. Life in the village was anything
but uneventful.</p>

<p>At first there was the whale to be attended
to, and all the village turned out for that. The
huge creature had drifted ashore on the farther
side of the island, and Ted was much interested
in seeing him gradually disposed of. Great
masses of blubber were stripped from the sides
to be used later both for food and fuel, the
whalebone was carefully secured to be sold to
the traders, and it seemed to Ted that there
was not one thing in that vast carcass for which
the Indians did not have some use.</p>

<p>Ted soon tired of watching the many things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
done with the whale, but there was plenty to do
and see in the village.</p>

<p>The village houses were all alike. There
was one large room in which the people cooked,
ate, and slept. The girls had blankets strung
across one corner, behind which were their beds.
Teddy was given one also for his corner of the
great room in the Tyee's house.</p>

<p>He learned to eat the food and to like it very
much. There was dried fish, herons' eggs, berries,
or those put up in seal oil, which is obtained
by frying the fat out of the blubber of
the seal. The Alaskans use this oil in nearly all
their cooking, and are very fond of it. Ted
ate also dried seaweed, chopped and boiled in
seal oil, which tasted very much like boiled and
salted leather, but he liked it very well. Indeed
he grew so strong and well, out-of-doors all day
in the clear air and bright sunshine of the Alaskan
June, that he could eat anything and tramp
all day without being too tired to sleep like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
top all night, and wake ready for a new day
with a zest he never felt at home.</p>

<p>Fresh fish were plentiful. The boys caught
salmon, smelts, and whitefish, and many were
dried for the coming winter, while clams, gum-boots,
sea-cucumbers, and devil-fish, found on
the rocks of the shore, were every-day diet.</p>

<p>Kalitan's sister and Ted became great friends.
She was older than Kalitan, and, though only
fifteen, was soon to be married to Tah-ge-ah,
a fine young Indian who was ready to pay high
for her, which was not strange, for she was
both pretty and sweet.</p>

<p>"At the next full moon," said Kalitan,
"there will be a potlatch, and Tanana will be
sold to Tah-ge-ah. He says he will give four
hundred blankets for her, and my uncle is well
pleased. Many only pay ten blankets for a
wife, but of course we would not sell my sister
for that. She is of high caste, chief's daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
niece, and sister," the boy spoke proudly, and
Ted answered:</p>

<p>"She's so pretty, too. She's not like the
Indian girls I saw at Wrangel and Juneau.
Why, there the women sat around as dirty as
dogs on the sidewalk, and didn't seem to care
how they looked. They had baskets to sell,
and were too lazy to care whether any one
bought them or not. They weren't a bit like
Tanana. She's as pretty as a Japanese."</p>

<p>Kalitan smiled, well pleased, and Ted added,
"I guess the Thlinkits must be the best Indians
in Alaska."</p>

<p>Kalitan laughed outright at this.</p>

<p>"Thlinkits pretty good," he said. "Tanana
good girl. She learned much good at
the mission school, marry Tah-ge-ah, and
make people better. She can weave blankets,
make fine baskets, and keep house like a white
girl."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's all right," said Ted. "But, Kalitan,
what is a potlatch?"</p>

<p>"Potlatch is a good-will feast," said his
friend. "Very fine thing, but white men do
not like. Say Indian feasts are all bad. Why
is it bad when an Indian gives away all his goods
for others? That is what a great potlatch is.
When white men give us whiskey and it is
drunk too much, then it is very bad. But Tyee
will not have that for Tanana's feast. We will
drink only quass,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> as my people made it before
they learned evil drinks and fire-water, which
make them crazy."</p>

<p>"I guess Tyee Klake was right when he said
all men were alike," said Ted, sagely. "It
seems to me that there are good and bad ones
in all countries. It's a pity you have had such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
bad white ones here in Alaska, but I guess you
have had good ones, too."</p>

<p>"Plenty good, plenty bad, Thlinkit men and
Boston men," said Kalitan, "all same."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TWILIGHT TALES AND TOTEMS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Once</span> a small girl child went by night to
bring water. In the skies above she saw the
Moon shining brightly, pale and placid, and she
put forth her tongue at it, which was an evil
thing, for the Moon is old, and a Thlinkit child
should show respect for age. So the Moon
would not endure so rude a thing from a girl
child, and it came down from the sky and took
her thither. She cried out in fear and caught at
the long grass to keep herself from going up,
but the Moon was strong and took her with
her water-bucket and her bunch of grass, and
she never came back. Her mother wept for
her, but her father said: 'Cease. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
other girl children; she is now wedded to the
Moon; to him we need not give a potlatch.'</p>

<p>"You may see her still, if you will look at
the Moon, there, grass in one hand, bucket in
the other, and when the new Moon tips to one
side and the water spills from the clouds and
it is the months of rain, it is the bad Moon
maiden tipping over her water-bucket upon the
earth. No Thlinkit child would dare ever to
put her tongue forth at the Moon, for fear of
a like fate to that of Squi-ance, the Moon
maiden."</p>

<p>Tanana's voice was soft and low, and she
looked very pretty as she sat in the moonlight
at the door of the hut and told Kalitan and
Ted quaint old stories. Ted was delighted
with her tales, and begged for another and yet
another, and Tanana told the quaint story of
Kagamil.</p>

<p>"A mighty <i>toyon</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> dwelt on the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of Kagamil. By name he was Kat-haya-koochat,
and he was of great strength and much
to be feared. He had long had a death feud
with people of the next totem, but the bold
warrior Yakaga, chieftain of the tribe, married
the toyon's daughter, and there was no more
feud. Zampa was the son of Kat-haya-koochat,
and his pride. He built for this son a fine
<i>bidarka</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the boy launched it on the sea.
His father watched him sail and called him
to return, lest evil befall. But Zampa heard not
his father's voice and pursued diving birds,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and, lo! he was far from land and the dark
fell. He sailed to the nearest shore and beheld
the village of Yakaga, where the people of
his sister's husband made him welcome, though
Yakaga was not within his hut. There was
feasting and merry-making, and, according to
their custom, he, the stranger, was given a chieftain's
daughter to wife, and her name was Kitt-a-youx;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and Zampa loved her and she him,
and he returned not home. But Kitt-a-youx's
father liked him not, and treated him with
rudeness because of the old enmity with his
Tyee father, so Zampa said to Kitt-a-youx:
'Let us go hence. We cannot be happy here.
Let us go from your father, who is unfriendly
to me, and seek the <i>barrabora</i> of my father,
the mighty chief, that happiness may come upon
us,' and Kitt-a-youx said: 'What my lord says
is well.'</p>

<p>"Then Zampa placed her in his canoe, and
alone beneath the stars they sailed and it was
well, and Zampa's arm was strong at his paddle.
But, lo! they heard another paddle, and
one came after them, and soon arrows flew
about them, arrows swift and cruel, and one
struck his paddle from his hand and his canoe
was overturned. The pursuer came and placed
Kitt-a-youx in his canoe, seeking, too, for
Zampa, but, alas! Zampa was drowned. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
when his pursuer dragged his body to the surface,
he gave a mighty cry, for, lo! it was his
brother-in-law whom he had pursued, for he
was Yakaga. Then fearing the terrible rage
of Zampa's father, he dared not return with
the body, so he left it with the overturned canoe
in the kelp and weeds. Kitt-a-youx he bore
with him to his own island. There she was sad
as the sea-gull's scream, for the lord she loved
was dead. And her father gave her to another
<i>toyon</i>, who was cruel to her, and her life was
as a slave's, and she loathed her life until
Zampa's child was born to her, and for it she
lived. Alas, it was a girl child and her husband
hated it, and Kitt-a-youx saw nothing for
it but to be sold as a slave as was she herself.
And she looked by day and by night at the sea,
and its cold, cold waves seemed warmer to her
than the arms of men. 'With my girl child I
shall go hence,' she whispered to herself, 'and
the Great Unknown Spirit will be kind.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"So by night she stole away in a canoe and
steered to sea, ere she knew where she was,
reaching the seaweeds where she had journeyed
with her young husband. The morning broke,
and she saw the weeds and the kelp where her
lover had gone from her sight, and, with a glad
sigh, she clasped Zampa's child to her breast
and sank down among the weeds where he had
died. So her tired spirit was at rest, for a
woman is happier who dies with him she
loves.</p>

<p>"Now Zampa's father had found his boy's
body and mourned over it, and buried it in a
mighty cave, the which he had once made for
his furs and stores. With it he placed bows
and arrows and many valuables in respect for
the dead. And Zampa's sister, going to his
funeral feast, fell upon a stone with her child,
so that both were killed. Then broke the old
chief's heart. Beside her brother he laid her
in the cave, and gave orders that he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
should be placed there as well, when grief
should have made way with him. Then he died
of sorrow for his children, and his people interred
him in his burial cave, and with him they
put much wealth and blankets and weapons.</p>

<p>"When, therefore, the people of his tribe
found the bodies of Kitt-a-youx and her child
among the kelp, having heard of her love for
Zampa, they bore them to the same cave, and,
wrapping them in furs, they placed Kitt-a-youx
beside her beloved husband, and in her burial
she found her home and felt the kindness of the
Great Spirit. This, then, is the story of the
burial cave of Kagamil, and since that day no
man dwelt upon the island, and it is known as
the 'island of the dead.'"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see it, I can tell you," said Ted.
"Are there any burial caves around here?"</p>

<p>"The Thlinkits do not bury in caves," said
Tanana. "We used to burn our dead, but
often we place them in totem-poles."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought those great poles by your doors
were totems," said Ted, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl. "They are caste totems,
and all who are of any rank have them.
As we belong to the Raven, or Bear, or Eagle
clan, we have the carved poles to show our
rank, but the totem of the dead is quite different.
It does not stand beside the door, but far
away. It is alone, as the soul of the dead in
whose honour it is made. It is but little carved.
A square hole is cut at the back of the pole,
and the body of the dead, wrapped in a matting
of cedar bark, is placed within, a board being
nailed so that the body will not fall to the
ground. A potlatch is given, and food from
the feast is put in the fire for the dead person."</p>

<p>"It seems queer to put weapons and blankets
and things to eat on people's graves," said Ted.
"Why do they do it?"</p>

<p>"Of the dead we know nothing," said Tanana.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"Perhaps the warrior spirit wishes his
arrows in the Land of the Great Unknown."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he can't come back for them,"
persisted Ted.</p>

<p>"At Wrangel, Boston man put flowers on
his girl's grave," said Kalitan, drily. "She
come back and smell posy?"</p>

<p>Having no answer ready, Ted changed the
subject and asked:</p>

<p>"Why do you have the raven at the top of
your totem pole?"</p>

<p>"Indian cannot marry same totem," said
Kalitan. "My father was eagle totem, my
mother was raven totem. He carve her totem
at the top of the pole, then his totem and those
of the family are carved below. The greater
the family the taller the totem."</p>

<p>"How do you get these totems?" demanded
Ted.</p>

<p>"Clan totems we take from our parents, but
a man may choose his own totem. Before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
becomes a man he must go alone into the forest
to fast, and there he chooses his totem, and he
is brother to that animal all his life, and may
not kill it. When he comes forth, he may take
part in all the ceremonies of his tribe."</p>

<p>"Why, it is something like knighthood and
the vigil at arms and escutcheons, and all those
Round-Table things," exclaimed Ted, in delight,
for he dearly loved the stirring tales of
King Arthur and his knights and the doughty
deeds of Camelot.</p>

<p>"Tell us about that," said Kalitan, so Ted
told them many tales in the moonlight, as they
sat beneath the shadows of the quaint and curious
totem-poles of Kalitan's tribe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BERRY DANCE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Teddy's</span> month upon the island stretched
out into two. His father came and went, finding
the boy so happy and well that he left him
with an easy mind. Ted's fair skin was tanned
to a warm brown, and, clad in Indian clothes,
save for his aureole of copper-coloured hair,
so strong a contrast to the straight black locks
of his Indian brothers, he could hardly be told
from one of the island lads who roamed all
day by wood and shore. They called him
"Yakso pil chicamin,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and all the village
liked him.</p>

<p>Tanana's marriage-feast was held, and she
and Tah-ge-ah went to housekeeping in a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hut, where the one room was as clean and neat
as could be, and not a bit like the dirty rooms
of some of the natives. Tanana spent all her
spare time weaving beautiful baskets, for her
slim fingers were very skilful. Some of the
baskets which she made out of the inner bark
of the willow-tree were woven so closely that
they would hold water, and Teddy never tired
of watching her weave the gay colours in and
out, nor of seeing the wonderful patterns grow.
Tah-ge-ah would take them to the mainland
when she had enough made, and sell them to
the travellers from the States. Meantime Tah-ge-ah
himself was very, very busy carving the
totem-pole for his new home, for Tanana was
a chieftain's daughter, and he, too, was of high
caste, and their totem must be carved and stand
one hundred feet high beside their door, lest
they be reproached.</p>

<p>Ted also enjoyed seeing old Kala-kash carve,
for he was the finest carver among the Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and it was wonderful to see him cut strange
figures out of bone, wood, horn, fish-bones, and
anything his gnarled old fingers could get hold
of, and he would carve grasshoppers, bears,
minnows, whales, sea-gulls, babies, or idols.
He made, too, a canoe for Ted, a real Alaskan
dugout, shaping the shell from a log and making
it soft by steam, filling the hole with water
and throwing in red-hot stones. The wood was
then left to season, and Ted could hardly wait
patiently until sun and wind and rain had made
his precious craft seaworthy. Then it was
painted with paint made by rubbing a certain
rock over the surface of a coarse stone and the
powder mixed with oil or water.</p>

<p>At last it was done, a shapely thing, more
beautiful in Ted's eyes than any launch or yacht
he had ever seen at home. His canoe had a
carved stern and a sharp prow which came out
of the water, and which had carved upon it a
fine eagle. Kala-kash had not asked Ted what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his totem was, but supposing that the American
eagle on the buttons of the boy's coat was his
emblem, had carved the rampant bird upon the
canoe as the boy's totem. Ted learned to paddle
and to fish, never so well as Kalitan, of
course, for he was born to it, but still he did
very well, and enjoyed it hugely.</p>

<p>Happily waned the summer days, and then
came the time of the berry dance, which Kalitan
had spoken of so often that Ted was very
anxious to see it.</p>

<p>The salmon-berry was fully ripe, a large and
luscious berry, found in two colours, yellow and
dark red. Besides these there were other small
berries, maruskins, like the New England dewberries,
huckleberries, and whortleberries.</p>

<p>"We have five kinds of berries on our
island," said Kalitan. "All good. The birds,
flying from the mainland, first brought the
seeds, and our berries grow larger than almost
any place in Alaska."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're certainly good," said Ted, his
mouth full as he spoke. "These salmon-berries
are a kind of a half-way between our blackberries
and strawberries. I never saw anything
prettier than the way the red and yellow berries
grow so thick on the same bush&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There come the canoes!" interrupted Kalitan,
and the two boys ran down to the water's
edge, eager to be the first to greet the visitors.
Tyee Klake was giving a feast to the people
of the neighbouring islands, and a dozen canoes
glided over the water from different directions.
The canoes were all gaily decorated, and they
came swiftly onward to the weird chant of the
paddlers, which the breeze wafted to the listeners'
ears in a monotonous melody.</p>

<p>Every one in the village had been astir since
daybreak, preparing for the great event. Parallel
lines had been strung from the chief's
house to the shore, and from these were hung
gay blankets, pieces of bright calico, and festoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of leaves and flowers. As the canoes
landed their occupants, the dancers thronged
to welcome their guests. The great drum
sounded its loud note, and the dancers, arrayed
in wonderful blankets woven in all manner of
fanciful designs and trimmed with long woollen
fringes, swayed back and forth, up and down,
to and fro, in a very graceful manner, keeping
time to the music.</p>

<p>In the centre of the largest canoe stood the
Tyee of a neighbouring island, a tall Indian,
dressed in a superb blanket with fringe a foot
long, fringed leggins and moccasins of walrus
hide, and the chief's hat to show his rank. It
was a peculiar head-dress half a foot high,
trimmed in down and feathers.</p>

<p>The Tyee, in perfect time to the music,
swayed back and forth, never ceasing for a
moment, shaking his head so that the down
was wafted in a snowy cloud all over him.</p>

<p>As the canoes reached the shallows, the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Indians dashed into the water to draw them
up to land, and the company was joyously received.
Teddy was delighted, for in one of
the canoes was his father, whom he had not
seen for several weeks. After the greetings
were over, the dancers arranged themselves in
opposite lines, men on one side, women on the
other, and swayed their bodies while the drum
kept up its unceasing tum-tum-tum.</p>

<p>"It's a little bit like square dances at home,"
said Ted. "It's ever so pretty, isn't it? First
they sway to the right, then to the left, over
and over and over; then they bend their bodies
forward and backward without bending their
knees, then sway again, and bend to one side
and then the other, singing all the time. Isn't
it odd, father?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is, but it's very graceful," said
Mr. Strong. "Some of the girls are quite
pretty, gentle-looking creatures, but the older
women are ugly."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"The very old women look like the mummies
in the museum at home," said Ted.
"There's one old woman, over a hundred years
old, whose skin is like a piece of parchment,
and she wears the hideous lip-button which
most of the Thlinkits have stopped using. Kalitan
says all the women used to wear them. The
girls used to make a cut in their chins between
the lip and the chin, and put in a piece of wood,
changing it every few days for a piece a little
larger until the opening was stretched like a
second mouth. When they grew up, a wooden
button like the bowl of a spoon was set in the
hole and constantly enlarged. The largest I
have seen was three inches long. Isn't it a
curious idea, father?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is, but there is no telling what
women will admire. A Chinese lady binds her
feet, and an American her waist; a Maori
woman slits her nose, and an English belle
pierces her ears. It's on the same principle that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
your Thlinkit friends slit their chins for the lip-button."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad they don't do it now, for
Tanana's as pretty as a pink, and it would be
a shame to spoil her face that way," said Ted.
"The dancing has stopped, father; let's see
what they'll do next. There comes Kalitan."</p>

<p>A feast of berries was to follow the dance,
and Kalitan led Mr. Strong and Ted to the
chief's house, which was gaily decorated with
blankets and bits of bright cloth. A table covered
with a cloth was laid around three sides
of the room, and on this was spread hardtack
and huge bowls of berries of different colours.
These were beaten up with sugar into a foamy
mixture, pink, purple, and yellow, according
to the colour of the berries, which tasted good
and looked pretty.</p>

<p>Ted and Kalitan had helped gather the berries,
and their appetites were quite of the best.
Mr. Strong smiled to see how the once fussy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
little gentleman helped himself with a right
good-will to the Indian dainties of his friends.</p>

<p>Many pieces of goods had been provided for
the potlatch, and these were given away, given
and received with dignified politeness. There
was laughing and merriment with the feast,
and when it was all over, the canoes floated
away as they had come, into the sunset, which
gilded all the sea to rosy, golden beauty.</p>

<p>Ted's share of the potlatch was a beautiful
blanket of Tanana's weaving, and he was delighted
beyond measure.</p>

<p>"You're a lucky boy, Ted," said his father.
"People pay as high as sixty-five dollars for
an Alaskan blanket, and not always a perfect
one at that. Many of the Indians are using
dyed yarns to weave them, but yours is the
genuine article, made from white goat's wool,
long and soft, and dyed only in the native reds
and blacks. We shall have to do something
nice for Tanana when you leave."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to give her something, and Kalitan,
too." Ted's face looked very grave.
"When do I have to go, father?"</p>

<p>"Right away, I'm afraid," was the reply.
"I've let you stay as long as possible, and now
we must start for our northern trip, if you are
to see anything at all of mines and Esquimos
before we start home. The mail-steamer passes
Nuchek day after to-morrow, and we must go
over there in time to take it."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Ted, forlornly. He wanted
to see the mines and all the wonderful things
of the far north, but he hated to leave his Indian
friends.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Ted?" His father
laid his hand on his shoulder, disliking to see
the bright face so clouded.</p>

<p>"I was only thinking of Kalitan," said
Ted.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take Kalitan with us," said
Mr. Strong.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, daddy, could we really?" Ted
jumped in excitement.</p>

<p>"I'll ask the Tyee if he will lend him to us
for a month," said Mr. Strong, and in a few
minutes it was decided, and Ted, with one great
bear's hug to thank his father, rushed off to
find his friend and tell him the glorious news.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON THE WAY TO NOME</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, boys, we're off for a long sail, and
I'm afraid you will be rather tired with the
steamer before you are done with her," said
Mr. Strong. They had boarded the mail-steamer
late the night before, and, going right
to bed, had wakened early next day and rushed
on deck to find the August sun shining in brilliant
beauty, the islands quite out of sight, and
nought but sea and sky around and above them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; we'll find something
to do," said Teddy. "You'll have to tell us
lots about the places we pass, and, if there aren't
any other boys on board, Kalitan and I will
be together. What's the first place we stop?"</p>

<p>"We passed the Kenai Peninsula in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
night. I wish you could have caught a glimpse
of some of the waterfalls, volcanoes, and glaciers.
They are as fine as any in Alaska," said
Mr. Strong. "Our next stop will be Kadiak
Island."</p>

<p>"Kadiak Island was once near the mainland,"
said Kalitan. "There was only the narrowest
passage of water, but a great Kenai
otter tried to swim the pass, and was caught
fast. He struggled so that he made it wider
and wider, and at last pushed Kadiak way out
to sea."</p>

<p>"He must have been a whopper," said Ted,
"to push it so far away. Is that the island?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father. "There are no
splendid forests on the island as there are on
the mainland, but the grasses are superb, for the
fog and rain here keeps them green as emerald."</p>

<p>"What a queer canoe that Indian has!" exclaimed
Ted. "It isn't a bit like yours, Kalitan."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is <i>bidarka</i>," said Kalitan. "Kadiak
people make canoe out of walrus hide. They
stretch it over frames of driftwood. It holds
two people. They sit in small hatch with apron
all around their bodies, and the <i>bidarka</i> goes
over the roughest sea and floats like a bladder.
Big <i>bidarka</i> called an <i>oomiak</i>, and holds whole
family."</p>

<p>"Some one has called the <i>bidarkas</i> the 'Cossacks
of the sea,'" said Mr. Strong. "They
skim along like swallows, and are as perfectly
built as any vessel I ever saw."</p>

<p>"What are those huge buildings on the small
island?" asked Ted, as the steamer wound
through the shallows.</p>

<p>"Ice-houses," said his father. "Before people
learned to manufacture ice, immense cargoes
were shipped from here to as far south
as San Francisco."</p>

<p>"It was fun to see them go fishing for ice
from the steamer when we came up to Skaguay,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
said Ted. "The sailors went out in a
boat, slipped a net around a block of ice and
towed it to the side of the ship, then it was
hitched to a derrick and swung on deck."</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Kalitan. "What people want
ice for stored up? Think they'd store sunshine!"</p>

<p>"If you could invent a way to do that, you
could make a fortune, my boy," said Mr.
Strong, laughing. "The next place of any
interest is Karluk. It's around on the other
side of the island in Shelikoff Strait, and is
famous for its salmon canneries. Nearly half
of the entire salmon pack of Alaska comes from
Kadiak Island, most of the fish coming from
the Karluk River."</p>

<p>"Very bad for Indians," said Kalitan.
"Used to have plenty fish. Tyee Klake said
salmon used to come up this river in shoal sixteen
miles long, and now Boston men take them
all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"It does seem a pity that the Indians don't
even have a chance to earn their living in the
canneries," said Mr. Strong. "The largest
cannery in the world is at Karluk. There are
thousands of men employed, and in one year
over three million salmon were packed, yet with
all this work for busy hands to do, the canneries
employ Chinese, Greek, Portuguese, and American
workmen in preference to the Indians,
bringing them by the shipload from San Francisco."</p>

<p>"What other places do we pass?" asked
Ted.</p>

<p>"A lot of very interesting ones, and I wish
we could coast along, stopping wherever we felt
like it," said Mr. Strong. "The Shumagin
Islands are where Bering, the great discoverer
and explorer, landed in 1741 to bury one of
his crew. Codfish were found there, and Captain
Cook, in his 'Voyages and Discoveries,'
speaks of the same fish. There is a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
fishery there now called the Davidson Banks,
and the codfishing fleet has its headquarters on
Popoff Island. Millions of codfish are caught
here every year. These islands are also a favourite
haunt of the sea otter. Belofsky, at the
foot of Mt. Pavloff, is the centre of the trade."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" width="357" height="500" alt="mountain in water with flock of birds flying by" />
<span class="caption">MOUNT SHISHALDIN.</span>
</div>

<p>"What kind of fur is otter?" asked Ted,
whose mind was so inquiring that his father
often called him the "living catechism."</p>

<p>"It is the court fur of China and Russia, and
at one time the common people were forbidden
by law to wear it," said Mr. Strong. "It is a
rich, purplish brown sprinkled with silver-tipped
hairs, and the skins are very costly."</p>

<p>"At one time any one could have otter," said
Kalitan. "We hunted them with spears and
bows and arrows. Now they are very few, and
we find them only in dangerous spots, hiding
on rocks or floating kelp. Sometimes the hunters
have to lie in hiding for days watching them.
Only Indians can kill the otter. Boston men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
can if they marry Indian women. That makes
them Indian."</p>

<p>"Rather puts otter at a discount and women
at a premium," laughed Mr. Strong. "Now
we pass along near the Alaska peninsula, past
countless isles and islets, through the Fox
Islands to Unalaska, and then into the Bering
Sea. One of the most interesting things in this
region is called the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' a
chain of volcanoes which stretches along the
coast. Often the passengers can see from the
ships at night a strange red glow over the sky,
and know that the fire mountains are burning.
The most beautiful of these volcanoes is Mt.
Shishaldin, nearly nine thousand feet high, and
almost as perfect a cone in shape as Fuji Yama,
which the Japanese love so much and call 'the
Honourable Mountain.' At Unalaska or Ilinlink,
the 'curving beach,' we stop. If we could
stay over for awhile, there are a great many
interesting things we could see; an old Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
church and the government school are in the
town, and Bogoslov's volcano and the sea-lion
rookeries are on the island of St. John, which
rose right up out of the sea in 1796 after a day's
roaring and rumbling and thundering. In 1815
there was a similar performance, and from time
to time the island has grown larger ever since.
One fine day in 1883 there was a great shower
of ashes, and, when the clouds had rolled away,
two peaks were seen where only one had been,
separated by a sandy isthmus. This last was
reduced to a fine thread by the earthquake of
1891, and I don't know what new freaks it
may have developed by now. I know some
friends of mine landed there not long ago and
cooked eggs over the jets of steam which gush
out of the mountainside. Did you ever hear of
using a volcano for a cook-stove?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say not," said Ted, amused.
"These Alaskan volcanoes are great things."</p>

<p>"The one called Makushin has a crater filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with snow in a part of which there is always a
cloud of sulphurous smoke. That's making
extremes meet, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yehl<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> made many strange things," said
Kalitan, who had been taking in all this information
even more eagerly than Teddy. "He
first dwelt on Nass River, and turned two blades
of grass into the first man and woman. Then
the Thlinkits grew and prospered, till darkness
fell upon the earth. A Thlinkit stole the sun
and hid it in a box, but Yehl found it and set
it so high in the heavens that none could touch
it. Then the Thlinkits grew and spread abroad.
But a great flood came, and all were swept away
save two, who tossed long upon the flood on a
raft of logs until Yehl pitied, and carried them
to Mt. Edgecomb, where they dwelt until the
waters fell."</p>

<p>"Old Kala-kash tells this story, and he says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that one of these people, when very old, went
down through the crater of the mountain, and,
given long life by Yehl, stays there always to
hold up the earth out of the water. But the
other lives in the crater as the Thunder Bird,
Hahtla, whose wing-flap is the thunder and
whose glance is the lightning. The osprey is
his totem, and his face glares in our blankets
and totems."</p>

<p>"I've wondered what that fierce bird was,"
said Teddy, who was always quite carried away
with Kalitan's strange legends.</p>

<p>"Well, what else do we see on the way to
Nome, father?"</p>

<p>"The most remarkable thing happening in
the Bering Sea is the seal industry, but I do not
think we pass near enough to the islands to see
any of that. You'd better run about and see
the ship now," and the boys needed no second
permission.</p>

<p>It was not many days before they knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
everybody on board, from captain to deck
hands, and were prime favourites with them
all. Ted and Kalitan enjoyed every moment.
There was always something new to see or hear,
and ere they reached their journey's end, they
had heard all about seals and sealing, although
the famous Pribylov Islands were too far to
the west of the vessel's route for them to see
them. They sighted the United States revenue
cutter which plies about the seal islands to keep
off poachers, for no one is allowed to kill seals
or to land on this government reservation except
from government vessels. The scent of
the rookeries, where millions of seals have been
killed in the last hundred years, is noticed far
out at sea, and often the barking of the animals
can be heard by passing vessels.</p>

<p>"Why is sealskin so valuable, father?"
asked Ted.</p>

<p>"It has always been admired because it is so
warm and soft," replied Mr. Strong. "All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ladies fancy it, and it never seems to go out of
fashion. There was a time, when the Pribylov
Islands were first discovered, that sealskins were
so plentiful that they sold in Alaska for a dollar
apiece. Hunters killed so many, killing old and
young, that soon there were scarcely any left,
so a law was passed by the Russian government
forbidding any killing for five years. Since the
Americans have owned Alaska they have protected
the seals, allowing them to be killed only
at certain times, and only male seals from two
to four years old are killed. The Indians are
always the killers, and are wonderfully swift and
clever, never missing a blow and always killing
instantly, so that there is almost no suffering."</p>

<p>"How do they know where to find the
seals?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"For half the year the seals swim about the
sea, but in May they return to their favourite
haunts. In these rookeries families of them
herd on the rocks, the male staying at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with his funny little black puppies, while the
mother swims about seeking food. The seals
are very timid, and will rush into the water
at the least strange noise. A story is told that
the barking of a little pet dog belonging to a
Russian at one of the rookeries lost him a hundred
thousand dollars, for the seals took fright
and scurried away before any one could say
'Jack Robinson!'"</p>

<p>"Rather an expensive pup!" commented
Ted. "But what about the seals, daddy?"</p>

<p>"You seem to think I am an encyclopdia
on the seal question," said his father. "There
is not much else to tell you."</p>

<p>"How can they manage always to kill the
right ones?" demanded Ted.</p>

<p>"The gay bachelor seals herd together away
from the rest and sleep at night on the rocks.
Early in the morning the Aleuts slip in between
them and the herd and drive them slowly to
the killing-ground, where they are quickly killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and skinned and the skins taken to the salting-house.
The Indians use the flesh and blubber,
and the climate is such that before another year
the hollow bones are lost in the grass and
earth."</p>

<p>"What becomes of the skins after they are
salted?"</p>

<p>"They are usually sent to London, where
they are prepared for market. The work is all
done by hand, which is one reason that they
are so expensive. They are first worked in sawdust,
cleaned, scraped, washed, shaved, plucked,
dyed with a hand-brush from eight to twelve
times, washed again and freed from the least
speck of grease by a last bath in hot sawdust
or sand."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder a sealskin coat costs so
much," said Ted, "if they have got to go
through all that performance. I wish we could
have seen the islands, but I'd hate to see the
seals killed. It doesn't seem like hunting just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to knock them on the head. It's too much like
the stock-yards at home."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's a satisfaction to know that
it's done in the easiest possible way for the
animals.</p>

<p>"What a lot you are learning way up here
in Alaska, aren't you, son? To-morrow we'll be
at Nome, and then your head will be so stuffed
with mines and mining that you will forget all
about everything else."</p>

<p>"I don't want to forget any of it," said Ted.
"It's all bully."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE GOLD COUNTRY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A low</span>, sandy beach, without a tree to break
its level, rows of plain frame-houses, some tents
and wooden shanties scattered about, the surf
breaking over the shore in splendid foam,&mdash;this
was Teddy's first impression of Nome.
They had sailed over from St. Michael's to
see the great gold-fields, and both the boys were
full of eagerness to be on land. It seemed,
however, as if their desires were not to be realized,
for landing at Nome is a difficult matter.</p>

<p>Nome is on the south shore of that part of
Alaska known as Seward Peninsula, and it has
no harbour. It is on the open seacoast and
catches all the fierce storms that sweep northward
over Bering Sea. Generally seacoast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
towns are built in certain spots because there
is a harbour, but Nome was not really built,
it "jes' growed," for, when gold was found
there, the miners sat down to gather the harvest,
caring nothing about a harbour.</p>

<p>Ships cannot go within a mile of land, and
passengers have to go ashore in small lighters.
Sometimes when they arrive, they cannot go
ashore at all, but have to wait several days,
taking refuge behind a small island ten miles
away, lest they drag their anchors and be dashed
to pieces on the shore.</p>

<p>There had been a tremendous storm at Nome
the day before Ted arrived, and landing was
more difficult than usual, but, impatient as the
boys were, at last it seemed safe to venture, and
the party left the steamer to be put on a rough
barge, flat-bottomed and stout, which was
hauled by cable to shore until it grounded on
the sands. They were then put in a sort of
wooden cage, let down by chains from a huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wooden beam, and swung round in the air like
the unloading cranes of a great city, over the
surf to a high platform on the land.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a new way to land," cried Ted,
who had been rather quiet during the performance,
and his father thought a trifle frightened.
"It's a sort of a balloon ascension, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It must be rather hard for the miners, who
have been waiting weeks for their mail, when
the boat can't land her bags at all," said Mr.
Strong. "That sometimes happens. From November
to May, Nome is cut off from the world
by snow and ice. The only news they receive
is by the monthly mail when it comes.</p>

<p>"Over at Kronstadt the Russians have ice-breaking
boats which keep the Baltic clear
enough of ice for navigation, and plow their
way through ice fourteen feet thick for two
hundred miles. The Nome miners are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
anxious for the government to try this ice-boat
service at Nome."</p>

<p>"Why did people settle here in such a forlorn
place?" asked Ted, as they made their way
to the town, which they found anything but
civilized. "I like the Indian houses on the
island better than this."</p>

<p>"Your island is more picturesque," said Mr.
Strong, "but people came here for what they
could get.</p>

<p>"In 1898 gold was discovered on Anvil
Creek, which runs into Snake River, and this
turned people's eyes in the direction of Nome.
Miners rushed here and set to work in the
gulches inland, but it was not till the summer
of 1899 that gold was found on the beach. A
soldier from the barracks&mdash;you know this is
part of a United States Military Reservation&mdash;found
gold while digging a well near the beach,
and an old miner took out $1,200 worth in
twenty days. Then a perfect frenzy seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
people. They flocked to Nome from far and
near; they camped on the beach in hundreds
and staked their claims. Between one and two
thousand men were at work on the beach at one
time, yet so good-natured were they that no
quarrels seem to have occurred. Doctors, lawyers,
barkeepers, and all dropped their business
and went to rocking, as they call beach-mining."</p>

<p>"Oh, dad, let's hurry and go and see it,"
cried Ted, as they hurried through their dinner
at the hotel. "I thought gold came out of deep
mines like copper, and had to be melted out or
something, but this seems to be different. Do
they just walk along the beach and pick it up?
I wish I could."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not quite so simple as that," said
Mr. Strong, laughing. "We'll go and see, and
then you'll understand," and they went down
the crooked streets to the sandy beach.</p>

<p>Men were standing about talking and laughing,
others working hard. All manner of men
were there scattered over the <i>tundra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and Ted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>became interested in two who were working
together in silence.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" he asked his father.
"I can't see how they expect to get anything
worth having out of this mess."</p>

<p>"Beach-mining is quite different from any
other," said his father. "Let's watch those
two men. They have evidently staked a claim
together, which means that nobody but these
two can work on the ground they have staked
out, and that they must share all the gold they
find. They came here to prospect, and evidently
found a block of ground which suited
them. They then dug a prospect hole down
two to five feet until they struck 'bedrock,'
which happens to be clay around here. They
passed through several layers of sand and
gravel before reaching this, and these were carefully
examined to see how much gold they contained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Upon reaching a layer which seemed
to be a good one, the gravel on top was stripped
off and thrown aside and the 'pay streak'
worked with the rocker."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Ted, who was all
ears, while Kalitan was taking in everything
with his sharp black eyes.</p>

<p>"That arrangement that looks like a square
pan on a saw-buck is the rocker. The rockers
usually have copper bottoms, and there is a
great demand for sheet copper at Nome, but
often there is not enough of it, and the miners
have been known to cover them with silver
coins. That man you are watching has silver
dollars in his, about fifty, I should say. It seems
extravagant, doesn't it, but he'll take out many
times that amount if he has good luck."</p>

<p>The man, who had glanced up at them,
smiled at that and said:</p>

<p>"And, if I don't have luck, I'm broke, anyhow,
so fifty or sixty plunks won't make much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
difference. You going to be a miner, youngster?"</p>

<p>"Not this trip," said Ted, with a smile.
"Say, I'd like to know how you get the gold
out with that."</p>

<p>"At first we used to put a blanket in the
rocker, and wash the pay dirt on that. Our
prospect hole has water in it, and we can use
it over and over. Some of the holes are dry,
and there the men have to pack their pay dirt
down to the shore and use surf water for washing.
Most of our gold is so fine that the
blanket didn't stop it, so now we use 'quick.'
I reckon you'd call it mercury, but we call it
quick. You see, it saves time, and work-time
up here is so short, on account of winter setting
in so early, that we have to save up our spare
minutes and not waste 'em on long words."</p>

<p>Ted grinned cheerfully and asked: "What
do you do with the quick?"</p>

<p>"We paint it over the bottom of the rocker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and it acts like a charm and catches every speck
of gold that comes its way as the dirt is washed
over it. The quick and the gold make a sort
of amalgam."</p>

<p>"But how do you get at the gold after it
amalgams, or whatever you call it?" asked
Ted.</p>

<p>"Sure we fry it in the frying-pan, and it's
elegant pancakes it makes," said the man. "See
here," and he pulled from his pocket several
flat masses that looked like pieces of yellow
sponge. "This is pure gold. All the quick
has gone off, and this is the real stuff, just as
good as money. An ounce will buy sixteen dollars'
worth of anything in Nome."</p>

<p>"It looks mighty pretty," said Ted. "Seems
to me it's redder than any gold I ever saw."</p>

<p>"It is," said his father. "Nome beach gold
is redder and brighter than any other Alaskan
gold. I guess I'll have to get you each a piece
for a souvenir," and both boys were made happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
by the present of a quaintly shaped nugget,
bought by Mr. Strong from the very miner who
had mined it, which of course added to its value.</p>

<p>"You're gathering quite a lot of souvenirs,
Ted," said his father. "It's a great relief that
you have not asked me for anything alive yet.
I have been expecting a modest request for a
Malamute or a Husky pup, or perhaps a pet
reindeer to take home, but so far you have been
quite moderate in your demands."</p>

<p>"Kalitan never asks for anything," said Ted.
"I asked him once why it was, and he said Indian
boys never got what they asked for; that
sometimes they had things given to them that
they hadn't asked for, but, if he asked the Tyee
for anything, all he got was 'Good Indian get
things for himself,' and he had to go to work
to get the thing he wanted. I guess it's a pretty
good plan, too, for I notice that I get just as
much as I did when I used to tease you for
things," Teddy added, sagely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wise boy," said his father. "You're certainly
more agreeable to live with. The next
thing you are to have is a visit to an Esquimo
village, and, if I can find some of the Esquimo
carvings, you shall have something to take home
to mother. Kalitan, what would you like to
remember the Esquimos by?"</p>

<p>Kalitan smiled and replied, simply, "<i>Mukluks</i>."</p>

<p>"What are <i>mukluks</i>?" demanded Ted.</p>

<p>"Esquimo moccasins," said Mr. Strong.
"Well, you shall both have a pair, and they
are rather pretty things, too, as the Esquimos
make them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AFTERNOON TEA IN AN EGLU</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Esquimo village was reached across the
<i>tundra</i>, and Teddy and Kalitan were much interested
in the queer houses. Built for the long
winter of six or eight months, when it is impossible
to do anything out-of-doors, the <i>eglu</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
seems quite comfortable from the Esquimo
point of view, but very strange to their American
cousins.</p>

<p>"I thought the Esquimos lived in snow
houses," said Ted, as they looked at the queer
little huts, and Kalitan exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Huh! Innuit queer Indian!"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Strong; "his hut is built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
by digging a hole about six feet deep and standing
logs up side by side around the hole. On
the top of these are placed logs which rest even
with the ground. Stringers are put across these,
and other logs and moss and mud roofed over
it, leaving an opening in the middle about two
feet square. This is covered with a piece of
walrus entrail so thin and transparent that light
easily passes through it, and it serves as a window,
the only one they have. A smoke-hole is
cut through the roof, but there is no door, for
the hut is entered through another room built
in the same way, fifteen or twenty feet distant,
and connected by an underground passage about
two feet square with the main room. The entrance-room
is entered through a hole in the
roof, from which a ladder reaches the bottom
of the passage."</p>

<p>"Can we go into a hut?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"I'll ask that woman cooking over there,"
said Mr. Strong, as they went up to a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
who was cooking over a peat fire, holding over
the coals an old battered skillet in which she
was frying fish. She nodded and smiled at the
boys, and, as Esquimos are always friendly and
hospitable souls, told them to go right into her
<i>eglu</i>, which was close by.</p>

<p>They climbed down the ladder, crawled
along the narrow passage to where a skin hung
before an opening, and, pushing it aside, entered
the living-room. Here they found an old man
busily engaged in carving a walrus tooth, another
sewing <i>mukluks</i>, while a girl was singing
a quaint lullaby to a child of two in the corner.</p>

<p>The young girl rose, and, putting the baby
down on a pile of skins, spoke to them in good
English, saying quietly:</p>

<p>"You are welcome. I am Alalik."</p>

<p>"May we see your wares? We wish to buy,"
said Mr. Strong, courteously.</p>

<p>"You may see, whether you buy or not," she
said, with a smile, which showed a mouth full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of even white teeth, and she spread out before
them a collection of Esquimo goods. There
were all kinds of carvings from walrus tusks,
grass baskets, moccasins of walrus hide, stone
bowls and cups, <i>parkas</i> made of reindeer skin,
and one superb one of bird feathers, <i>ramleikas</i>,
and all manner of carved trinkets, the most
charming of which, to Ted's eyes, being a tiny
<i>oomiak</i> with an Esquimo in it, made to be used
as a breast-pin. This he bought for his mother,
and a carving of a baby for Judith; while his
father made him and Kalitan happy with presents.</p>

<p>"Where did you learn such English?" asked
Mr. Strong of Alalik, wondering, too, where
she learned her pretty, modest ways, for Esquimo
women are commonly free and easy.</p>

<p>"I was for two years at the Mission at Holy
Cross," she said. "There I learned much that
was good. Then my mother died, and I came
home."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke simply, and Mr. Strong wondered
what would be the fate of this sweet-faced girl.</p>

<p>"Did you learn to sew from the sisters?"
asked Ted, who had been looking at the garments
she had made, in which the stitches,
though made in skins and sewn with deer sinew,
were as even as though done with a machine.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said. "We learn that at
home. When I was no larger than Zaksriner
there, my mother taught me to braid thread
from deer and whale sinew, and we must sew
very much in winter if we have anything to sell
when summer comes. It is very hard to get
enough to live. Since the Boston men come,
our people waste the summer in idleness, so
we have nothing stored for the winter's food.
Hundreds die and many sicknesses come upon
us. In the village where my people lived, in
each house lay the dead of what the Boston
men called measles, and there were not left
enough living to bury the dead. Only we escaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and a Black Gown came from the Mission
to help, and he took me and Antisarlook,
my brother, to the school. The rest came here,
where we live very well because there are in the
summer, people who buy what we make in the
winter."</p>

<p>"How do you get your skins so soft?" asked
Ted, feeling the exquisite texture of a bag she
had just finished. It was a beautiful bit of
work, a tobacco-pouch or "Tee-rum-i-ute,"
made of reindeer skin, decorated with beads and
the soft creamy fur of the ermine in its summer
hue.</p>

<p>"We scrape it a very long time and pull and
rub," she said. "Plenty of time for patience
in winter."</p>

<p>"Your hands are too small and slim. I
shouldn't think you could do much with those
stiff skins," said Teddy.</p>

<p>Alalik smiled at the compliment, and a little
flush crept into the clear olive of her skin. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was clean and neat, and the <i>eglu</i>, though close
from being shut up, was neater than most of the
Esquimo houses. The bowl filled with seal oil,
which served as fire and light, was unlighted,
and Alalik's father motioned to her and said
something in Innuit, to which she smilingly
replied:</p>

<p>"My father wishes you to eat with us," she
said, and produced her flint bag. In this were
some wads of fibrous material used for wicks.
Rolling a piece of this in wood ashes, she held
it between her thumb and a flint, struck her
steel against the stone, and sparks flew out
which lighted the fibre so that it burst into
flame. This was thrown into the bowl of oil,
and she deftly began preparing tea. She served
it in cups of grass, and Ted thought he had
never tasted anything nicer than the cup of
afternoon tea served in an <i>eglu</i>.</p>

<p>"Alalik, what were you singing as we came
in?" asked Ted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"A song my mother always sang to us," she
replied. "It is called 'Ahmi,' and is an Esquimo
slumber song."</p>

<p>"Will you sing it now?" asked Mr. Strong,
and she smiled in assent and sang the quaint,
crooning lullaby of her Esquimo mother&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"The wind blows over the Yukon.<br />
My husband hunts the deer on the Koyukun Mountains,<br />
Ahmi, Ahmi, sleep, little one, wake not.<br />
Long since my husband departed. Why does he wait in the mountains?<br />
Ahmi, Ahmi, sleep, little one, softly.<br />
Where is my own?<br />
Does he lie starving on the hillside? Why does he linger?<br />
Comes he not soon, I will seek him among the mountains.<br />
Ahmi, Ahmi, sleep, little one, sleep.<br />
The crow has come laughing.<br />
His beak is red, his eyes glisten, the false one.<br />
'Thanks for a good meal to Kuskokala the Shaman.<br />
On the sharp mountain quietly lies your husband.'<br />
Ahmi, Ahmi, sleep, little one, wake not.<br />
'Twenty deers' tongues tied to the pack on his shoulders;<br />
Not a tongue in his mouth to call to his wife with,<br />
Wolves, foxes, and ravens are fighting for morsels.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Tough and hard are the sinews, not so the child in your bosom.'<br />
Ahmi, Ahmi, sleep, little one, wake not.<br />
Over the mountains slowly staggers the hunter.<br />
Two bucks' thighs on his shoulders with bladders of fat between them.<br />
Twenty deers' tongues in his belt. Go, gather wood, old woman!<br />
Off flew the crow, liar, cheat, and deceiver!<br />
Wake, little sleeper, and call to your father.<br />
He brings you back fat, marrow and venison fresh from the mountain.<br />
Tired and worn, he has carved a toy of the deer's horn,<br />
While he was sitting and waiting long for the deer on the hillside.<br />
Wake, and see the crow hiding himself from the arrow,<br />
Wake, little one, wake, for here is your father."<br />
</div>

<p>Thanking Alalik for the quaint song, sung
in a sweet, touching voice, they all took their
departure, laden with purchases and delighted
with their visit.</p>

<p>"But you must not think this is a fair sample
of Esquimo hut or Esquimo life," said Mr.
Strong to the boys. "These are near enough
civilized to show the best side of their race, but
theirs must be a terrible existence who are inland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
or on islands where no one ever comes,
and whose only idea of life is a constant struggle
for food."</p>

<p>"I think I would rather be an American,"
remarked Ted, while Kalitan said, briefly:</p>

<p>"I like Thlinkit."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SPLENDOUR OF SAGHALIE TYEE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>tundra</i> was greenish-brown in colour,
and looked like a great meadow stretching from
the beach, like a new moon, gently upward to
the cones of volcanic mountains far away.</p>

<p>The ground, frozen solid all the year, thaws
out for a foot or two on the surface during the
warm months, and here and there were scattered
wild flowers; spring beauties, purple primroses,
yellow anemone, and saxifrages bloomed in
beauty, and wild honey-bees, gay bumblebees,
and fat mosquitoes buzzed and hummed everywhere.</p>

<p>Ted and Kalitan were going to see the reindeer
farm at Port Clarence, and, as this was
to be their last jaunt in Alaska, they were determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to make the best of it. Next day they
were to take ship from Cape Prince of Wales
and go straight to Sitka. Here Ted was to
start for home, and Mr. Strong was to leave
Kalitan at the Mission School for a year's
schooling, which, to Kalitan's great delight, was
to be a present to him from his American
friends.</p>

<p>"Tell us about the reindeer farms, daddy.
Have they always been here?" demanded Ted,
as they tramped over the <i>tundra</i>, covered with
moss, grass, and flowers.</p>

<p>"No," said his father. "They are quite
recent arrivals in Alaska. The Esquimos used
to live entirely upon the game they killed before
the whites came. There were many walruses,
which they used for many things; whales, too,
they could easily capture before the whalers
drove them north, and then they hunted the
wild reindeer, until now there are scarcely any
left. There was little left for them to eat but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
small fish, for you see the whites had taken away
or destroyed their food supplies.</p>

<p>"One day, in 1891, an American vessel discovered
an entire village of Esquimos starving,
being reduced to eating their dogs, and it was
thought quite time that the government did
something for these people whose land they had
bought. Finding that people of the same race
in Siberia were prosperous and healthy, they
sent to investigate conditions, and found that
the Siberian Esquimos lived entirely by means
of the reindeer. The government decided to
start a reindeer farm and see if it would not
benefit the natives."</p>

<p>"How does it work?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed," said his father. "At
first about two hundred animals were brought
over, and they increased about fifty per cent.
the first year. Everywhere in the arctic region
the <i>tundra</i> gives the reindeer the moss he lives
on. It is never dry in summer because the frost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
prevents any underground drainage, and even
in winter the animals feed upon it and thrive.
There are, it is said, hundreds of thousands of
square miles of reindeer moss in Alaska, and
reindeer stations have been established in many
places, and, as the natives are the only ones
allowed to raise them, it seems as if this might
be the way found to help the industrious Esquimos
to help themselves."</p>

<p>"But if it all belongs to the government,
how can it help the natives?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Of course they have to be taught the business,"
said Mr. Strong. "The government
brought over some Lapps and Finlanders to
care for the deer at first, and these took young
Esquimos to train. Each one serves five years
as herder, having a certain number of deer set
apart for him each year, and at the end of his
service goes into business for himself."</p>

<p>"Why, I think that's fine," cried Ted. "Oh,
Daddy, what is that? It looks like a queer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
tangled up forest, all bare branches in the summer."</p>

<p>"That's a reindeer herd lying down for their
noonday rest. What you see are their antlers.
How would you like to be in the midst of that
forest of branches?" asked Mr. Strong.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Teddy, but Kalitan
said:</p>

<p>"Reindeer very gentle; they will not hurt
unless very much frightened."</p>

<p>"What queer-looking animals they are," said
Ted, as they approached nearer. "A sort of a
cross between a deer and a cow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are more useful than handsome,
but I think there is something picturesque
about them, especially when hitched to sleds
and skimming over the frozen ground."</p>

<p>The farm at Teller was certainly an interesting
spot. Teddy saw the deer fed and milked,
the Lapland women being experts in that line,
and found the herders, in their quaint <i>parkas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tied around the waist, and conical caps, scarcely
less interesting than the deer. Two funny little
Lapp babies he took to ride on a large reindeer,
which proceeding did not frighten the babies
half so much as did the white boy who put them
on the deer. A reindeer was to them an every-day
occurrence, but a Boston boy was quite another
matter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 359px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;TWO FUNNY LITTLE LAPP BABIES HE TOOK TO RIDE ON A
LARGE REINDEER.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Better than the reindeer, however, Teddy
and Kalitan liked the draught dogs who hauled
the water at the station. A great cask on
wheels was pulled by five magnificent dogs,
beautiful fellows with bright alert faces.</p>

<p>"They are the most faithful creatures in
the world," said Mr. Strong, "devoted to their
masters, even though the masters are cruel to
them. Reindeer can work all day without a
mouthful to eat, living on one meal at night of
seven pounds of corn-meal mush, with a pound
or so of dried fish cooked into it. On long journeys
they can live on dried fish and snow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
five dogs will haul four hundred pounds thirty-five
miles a day. They carry the United States
mails all over Alaska."</p>

<p>"I should think the dog would be worth
more than the reindeer," said Ted.</p>

<p>"Many Alaskan travellers say he is by far
the best for travelling, but he cannot feed himself
on the <i>tundra</i>, nor can he be eaten himself
if necessary. The Jarvis expedition proved
the value of the reindeer," said Mr. Strong.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Some years ago a whale fleet was caught
in the ice near Point Barrow, and in danger
of starving to death, and word of this was sent
to the government. The President ordered the
revenue cutter <i>Bear</i> to go as far north as possible
and send a relief party over the ice by sledge
with provisions.</p>

<p>"When the <i>Bear</i> could go no farther, her
commander landed Lieutenant Jarvis, who was
familiar with the region, and a relief party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
They were to seek the nearest reindeer station
and drive a reindeer herd to the relief of the
starving people. The party reached Cape
Nome and secured some deer, and the rescue
was made, but under such difficulties that it is
one of the most heroic stories of the age.
These men drove four hundred reindeer over
two thousand miles north of the Arctic Circle,
over frozen seas and snow-covered mountains,
and found the starving sailors, who ate the
fresh reindeer meat, which lasted until the ice
melted in the spring and set them free."</p>

<p>"I think that was fine," said Ted. "But it
seems a little hard on the reindeer, doesn't it,
to tramp all that distance just to be eaten?"</p>

<p>"Animals made for man," said Kalitan,
briefly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A golden glory filled the sky, running upwards
toward the zenith, spreading there in
varying colours from palest yellow to orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and deepest, richest red. Glowing streams of
light streamed heavenward like feathery wings,
as Ted and Kalitan sailed southward, and Ted
exclaimed in wonder: "What is it?"</p>

<p>"The splendour of <i>Saghalie Tyee</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> said
Kalitan, solemnly.</p>

<p>"The Aurora Borealis," said Mr. Strong,
"and very fortunate you are to see it. Indeed,
Teddy, you seem to have brought good luck,
for everything has gone well this trip. Our
faces are turned homeward now, but we will

mother and Judith."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to get home to mother again,"
said Ted, then noting Kalitan's wistful face,
"We'll find you at Sitka and go home with you
to the island," and he put his arm affectionately
over the Indian boy's shoulder. Kalitan pointed
to the sky, whence the splendour was fading,
and a flock of birds was skimming southwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"From the sky fades the splendour of <i>Saghalie
Tyee</i>," he said. "The summer is gone,
the birds fly southward. The light goes from
me when my White Brother goes with the birds.
Unless he return with them, all is dark for
Kalitan!"</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
